## [1.75.2] — 2026-06-19

**docs: full documentation parity for the v1.75.0 scanner aggregators across all 12 locales.** No code change — brings the user-facing docs in line with the seven sources that landed in v1.75.0:

- **Help guide (12 locales).** §5 gains a `content_filter` block (description/snippet keyword gating, sibling of `location_filter`) and an aggregators note; §7 lists the seven new sources in the one-click-scan sweep and the full **Source** dropdown enumeration; §17's adapter count is corrected from the stale "11 adapters" to "19 adapters — 14 English + 5 Russian". No `##`/`###` heading was added, so the gated 19 H2 / 75 H3 structure is unchanged.
- **README (9 full locales).** New "Aggregator boards (v1.75.0)" bullet under the scan sources, plus the release badge bumped to v1.75.2. (The abbreviated pl/uk/ar READMEs have no per-source list and are intentionally untouched there.)
- **Reference docs.** `docs/portals-examples.md` gains a copy-paste "Aggregator boards" section with accurate `provider:` / `<provider>:` config blocks for all seven; `docs/PROJECT.md` updated to **19 adapters**; `docs/sdd/CONVENTIONS.md` documents the two-registry distinction (`sources/registry.mjs` for the dropdown vs `portals/registry.mjs` for fetching), the `provider:`-based aggregator selection threaded as `opts.company`, the scan-write sanitizer (`scan-sanitize.mjs`), and the v1.75.1 test count (1190).
- **QA.** Added `qa/QA-REGRESSION-PROMPT-v1.75.2-FULL.md` — the full-surface release-gate driver, refreshed for the v1.75.x scan-aggregator cycle.

---



## [1.75.1] — 2026-06-19

**fix(scan): robustness polish on the v1.75.0 config-driven sources.** Three small hardening fixes from the post-release review (no behavior change for a healthy scan):

- **Abort-aware pagination delays.** The Glints (300 ms) and Jobstreet/SEEK (200 ms) inter-page courtesy pauses now resolve immediately when the scan's `AbortSignal` fires, via a new `delay(ms, signal)` helper in `server/lib/http-json.mjs`, so a disconnected client can't hold a paginating scan open for an extra pause.
- **Descriptive non-JSON error.** `fetchJson` now wraps a non-JSON `2xx` body (e.g. an HTML maintenance page served with status 200) as `non-JSON 2xx response from <url>` instead of surfacing a bare `SyntaxError`, so the scanner's per-source error log names the misbehaving endpoint.
- **Stronger scan-write normalization.** `normalizeScanScalar` now collapses the vertical tab, form feed, and the Unicode line/paragraph separators (`\v \f U+2028 U+2029`) in addition to `\r \n \t` — a strict superset, so no record/line separator a spreadsheet or viewer might honor survives into `scan-history.tsv`.

---


## [1.75.0] — 2026-06-19

**feat(scan): port parent career-ops v1.12.0 — seven new job sources, content filtering, and security/quality fixes.** The web-ui runs its own in-process scanners (it does not shell out to the parent's `scan.mjs`), so parent v1.12.0's provider and scan changes do not flow through automatically — this release reimplements the applicable ones in the web-ui's adapter contract.

- **Seven new scanner sources.** Three board-wide remote aggregators — **RemoteOK**, **Remotive**, **Working Nomads** — drop into the auto-discovered `server/lib/sources/*.mjs` pattern (select with `provider: remoteok` / `remotive` / `workingnomads`). Four config-driven regional aggregators — **IBM** careers, **Arbeitsagentur** (German Federal Labor Agency), **Glints** (SE Asia), **Jobstreet / SEEK** — read a per-entry `<provider>:` config block; en-scanner now threads the resolved company entry through to every fetcher so they can read it. All seven appear in the `#/scan` source dropdown automatically.
- **`content_filter` (parent #974).** Optional `portals.yml` block (`positive` / `negative` keyword lists) that gates a posting on its description/snippet text — mirrors `location_filter` semantics; postings without a description always pass. Wired into both EN and RU scanners.
- **Scan-write hardening (parent #1098).** External feed metadata is now sanitized before it lands in `data/scan-history.tsv` and `data/pipeline.md`: control characters are collapsed (a company/title newline can no longer inject a TSV row) and a leading `= + - @` is neutralized against spreadsheet formula injection.
- **Ashby `secondaryLocations` (parent #1073).** The Ashby source now folds each secondary location's region label plus postal `addressLocality` / `addressCountry` into the location string (deduped), so an EU-eligible role whose primary label reads e.g. "Canada" surfaces for the `location_filter`.
- **Evaluation report-shape validation (parent #819).** `/api/evaluate`'s in-process providers (Anthropic / OpenAI / Qwen / OpenRouter / GitHub Models) now flag a malformed A–G / `SCORE_SUMMARY` report as a non-fatal `warnings` array; the Gemini eval path already inherits the guard from the parent's `gemini-eval.mjs`.
- **docs:** Antigravity CLI added to the supported-assistant lists across all 12 READMEs (maps to the Gemini provider).

Inherited for free from the `git pull` of the parent (web-ui shells out to these): Japanese CJK PDF font fallback (#1053), ATS-safe PDF fonts (#1074), LaTeX CJK guard (#1054), tracker/merge/followup/dashboard fixes, and the `modes/zh` Chinese modes (the web-ui lists modes dynamically).

---


## [1.74.3] — 2026-06-18

**docs(parent-source): point the parent `career-ops` repo at the [`Fighter90/career-ops`](https://github.com/Fighter90/career-ops) fork.** The web-ui now references the maintainer's fork as the parent project everywhere it is a live source: the `bin/setup.sh` installer's `CAREER_OPS_REPO` clone default, every `git clone` / "sits on top of" / onboarding link across all 12 READMEs, and the agent docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `docs/`). Author credit to santifer (and the unofficial-UI disclaimer) is unchanged — only the source/clone URLs moved. `tests/sh-files.test.mjs` now asserts the installer clones the fork.

---


## [1.74.2] — 2026-06-17

**fix(health): surface `GITHUB_MODELS_API_KEY` as an optional check on `#/health` and in `/api/status/providers`.** The v1.74.0 GitHub Models provider was configurable in `#/config` but had no row on the Health page and was missing from the `keysConfigured` provider surface. Added the optional check (same "set / unset (manual mode)" wording as the other five live-eval providers) and `github` (+ its `GITHUB_MODELS_MODEL`) to `/api/status/providers`, so the active-provider routing and Health page now reflect all six. `tests/api.test.mjs` health-row test extended to all six providers.

---



## [1.74.1] — 2026-06-17

**docs + test: README "Install an AI assistant" section; full branch coverage for the Gemini connector.** Added an install/login table to the README — install links for **Claude Code / Gemini CLI / Codex / Qwen Code / OpenCode / GitHub Copilot CLI** + each one's `#/config` provider mapping + "log in before continuing" (mirrors the career-ops.org/docs Quick Start; clarifies the web-ui is the standalone, no-CLI-needed alternative). New `tests/gemini-connector.test.mjs` (8 cases) covers every `runGemini` branch — no-key, success, API error, empty/blocked completion, malformed body, timeout, network error, `hasGeminiKey` — taking `server/lib/gemini.mjs` to **100% statements**. Overall coverage **96% lines / 88% branch / 96% funcs**. Suite 1126 → 1134.

---



## [1.74.0] — 2026-06-17

**feat(llm): GitHub Models (Copilot) as the 6th provider + canonical 6-assistant alignment.** [career-ops.org/docs](https://career-ops.org/docs) lists six AI coding assistants — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Qwen Code, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot CLI. The web-ui now supports all six: five map to existing live providers (Anthropic / Gemini / OpenAI / Qwen / OpenRouter), and **GitHub Copilot CLI** gains a dedicated **GitHub Models** connector — `runGitHubModels` (OpenAI-compatible; a GitHub PAT with the `models` scope), configurable in `#/config` (`GITHUB_MODELS_API_KEY` + `GITHUB_MODELS_MODEL`) and selectable via `LLM_PROVIDER=github`; 6th in the `auto` order. Help bundles + READMEs now list the canonical six (renamed Qwen CLI→Qwen Code; added Gemini CLI + GitHub Copilot CLI), and the README adds a full **mode-reference + portal-adapter link table** to career-ops.org/docs so every feature traces back to the parent. `tests/llm-provider-context.test.mjs` extends the fetch-boundary matrix to all six providers (cv.md + profile.yml inlined + artifact returned); new `GITHUB_MODELS_*` keys added to all 12 locale dictionaries. Suite 1125 → 1126.

---



## [1.73.0] — 2026-06-17

**feat(llm): generic Gemini connector + verified CV/profile context across all providers.** Added `server/lib/gemini.mjs` (`runGemini`) — a zero-dependency Gemini `generateContent` client returning the same `{markdown, usage, error}` shape as the Anthropic / OpenAI-compatible clients. **Fix:** `/api/mode/:slug` and `/api/deep` previously piped their prompts through the oferta-only `gemini-eval.mjs`, so Gemini **Run live** returned an *evaluation* instead of the requested artifact (cover letter, outreach, brief). They now call `runGemini` with `bundleProjectContext`, so `cv.md` + `config/profile.yml` are inlined for Gemini exactly like every other provider — letters/briefs are detailed and personalized. New `tests/llm-provider-context.test.mjs` mocks each provider's HTTP boundary and asserts all five (Anthropic / Gemini / OpenAI / Qwen / OpenRouter) inline `cv.md` + `profile.yml` and return the artifact (mode + deep + evaluate matrix, 9 cases). `/api/evaluate` keeps its oferta-tuned `gemini-eval.mjs`. Suite 1116 → 1125.

---



## [1.72.0] — 2026-06-17

**feat(modes): "Run live" now returns the final artifact directly (single-shot output contract).** The parent `modes/<slug>.md` templates are written for interactive Claude Code sessions — several (cover, contacto, …) pause to ask clarifying questions before producing the result, which made the web-ui's single-shot **Run live** emit a questionnaire instead of the artifact. `buildModePrompt` now wraps every mode in a non-interactive **output contract**: do the analysis (JD breakdown, company notes, ATS keywords, profile↔JD gaps, tone/angle choices) **silently**, pick sensible defaults from `cv.md` / `config/profile.yml` for anything the template would normally ask, and output **only the final artifact** — closed with a per-mode "output ONLY {the cover letter / outreach message / …}" reminder. So clicking **Run live** on `#/cover` now returns the cover letter itself; the same fix applies to every generic mode (cover, contacto, interview-prep, project, training, followup, patterns) in all 12 locales (the artifact is written in the UI language via the locale directive). Suite 1103 → 1116.

---



## [1.71.2] — 2026-06-17

**docs(i18n): publish the documentation-consistency pass.** Every README "Translations of this guide" block now lists all 11 sibling languages (previously some omitted English/Français and self-linked), with the blank line before the section break restored. The full QA regression prompt is renamed to the current version, and the docs (CLAUDE.md, CONVENTIONS, LOCALIZATION, PROJECT-CONTEXT) are synced to the current version and test count (1103). No code or behavior change — docs only, so the help/UI translations and all features from 1.70.0–1.71.1 are unchanged.

---



## [1.71.1] — 2026-06-17

**fix(i18n): the in-app help guide is now fully translated in all 12 languages.** Added `docs/help/{pl,uk,ar}.md` (each holding the gated 19 H2 / 75 H3 structure) so `#/help` serves a native bundle for Polish, Ukrainian, and Arabic instead of falling back to English — `GET /api/help/{pl,uk,ar}` now return their own locale. Wired into every help gate (`help-ui`, `help.test`, `help-ru-config-section`, `canonical-docs-coverage`). Also completed every 12-language translation list: the README "Translations of this guide" block (9 READMEs), the localized CHANGELOG "Translations:" headers (8 files), and refreshed stale doc counts (CONVENTIONS test count → 1100; help "fall back" notes → 12 translated bundles). Suite 1100 → 1103.

---



## [1.71.0] — 2026-06-16

**feat(cover): generate a cover-letter PDF straight from `#/cover`.** The cover mode (added in v1.70.0) produces the letter text; the result now offers a **Generate PDF** button that renders it through the shared inline markdown→PDF pipeline (`POST /api/stream/pdf/inline` → `generate-pdf.mjs`), the same path interview-prep uses. You can now produce the letter and ship a PDF without leaving the SPA.

**test/docs: v1.70.0 review hardening.** Added CI-isolated coverage for the cover mode (allowlist + prompt assembly, via `modes-endpoints.test.mjs`), the flag `<select>` switcher + Arabic RTL (`dirFor`/`<html dir>`, new `tests/lang-switcher-rtl.test.mjs`), `top.langLabel` in every locale, the cover-letter PDF wiring (`tests/cover-letter-pdf.test.mjs`), and the `prompts.mjs` locale directive + scaffolding for fr/pl/uk/ar (`tests/locale-scaffold.test.mjs` — locking the latent French gap closed in v1.70.0). Refreshed three stale "all 8" → 12-locale / 9-help-bundle references in `docs/sdd/CONVENTIONS.md`. Refreshed the full-project QA regression prompt (`qa/QA-REGRESSION-PROMPT-v1.71.0-FULL.md`).

---



## [1.70.0] — 2026-06-16

**feat(i18n): three new UI languages — Polish (pl), Ukrainian (uk), and Arabic (ar, with full RTL) — bringing the SPA to 12 locales, matching every language in the parent career-ops README.** Each new locale ships a complete 697-key dictionary (`public/js/lib/locales/i18n-dict.{pl,uk,ar}.js`), gated by the existing parity / coverage / no-latin-leak / no-personal-data suites. Arabic adds genuine right-to-left support: `i18n.js` sets `<html dir="rtl">` for RTL locales and a scoped `[dir="rtl"]` block in `app.css` mirrors the chrome (sidebar, notifications drawer, markdown tables/blockquotes, inline spacing) — LTR locales are byte-for-byte unchanged. New `top.langLabel` key (×12) names the picker for screen readers.

**feat(ui): flag-icon `<select>` language switcher replaces the wrapping button row.** With 12 locales the old `.lang-btn` row wrapped to three lines in the sidebar; a native `<select>` (each option prefixed with a flag emoji) scales cleanly, is keyboard- and screen-reader-friendly out of the box, and stays CSP-safe (change handler via `addEventListener`, no inline JS). Flags degrade to region letters where the platform lacks flag glyphs, so the language label is always the load-bearing identifier.

**feat(cover): port the parent's cover-letter mode (career-ops v1.10.0 + v1.11.0 greeting) into the SPA.** New `#/cover` page under the Application nav group, built on the generic mode runner: Job description + Company/Role + an optional salutation → a tailored letter generated from `cv.md` / `modes/_profile.md`. Added `cover` to the server `MODE_ALLOWLIST` and a `cover.*` i18n block (×12 locales).

**chore(compat): track parent career-ops v1.11.0.** Verified the read/write contract is intact — `data/applications.md` stays the markdown source of truth (the v1.11.0 SQLite tracker index is a derived cache), tracker columns are still header-mapped. `parentVersion` now reports 1.11.0.

**fix(i18n): close a latent gap where French (added v1.61.0) was missing from `server/lib/prompts.mjs` `LOCALE_NAMES` and `SCAFFOLD_STRINGS`** — French LLM calls silently defaulted to English output and English scaffolding. fr/pl/uk/ar are now all wired into the prompt-locale path.

> Known follow-ups (tracked in `qa/v1.70-regression/`): the in-app **help guide** (`docs/help/`) falls back to English for pl/uk/ar (the UI chrome itself is fully localized); the parent's interactive **interview onboarding**, **reverse-ATS discovery**, and newer **scan providers** are not yet surfaced in the SPA.

---



## [1.69.2] — 2026-06-12

**fix(test): close a test-isolation leak that let `npm test` overwrite the user's real `config/profile.yml` and `data/scan-history.tsv`.** `tests/critical-fixes.test.mjs` statically imported `prompts.mjs` at the top of the file; `prompts.mjs` transitively imports `paths.mjs`, which resolves `PROJECT_ROOT` eagerly at module load (PATHS resolves once per process). Because that import ran **before** the `before()` hook set `CAREER_OPS_ROOT` to a temp dir, PATHS pinned the **real** parent — so the F-008 `PUT /api/profile` wrote the "Acceptance Test" fixture into the user's real profile on every run (and similar writes escaped the temp root). Fix: load `prompts.mjs` via **dynamic `import()`** inside `before()`, after the env is set (the server was already loaded that way). New `tests/test-root-isolation.test.mjs` (2 cases) guards every isolation-needing test against statically importing a `paths.mjs` carrier (`server/index.mjs`, `prompts.mjs`, `store.mjs`, `en-scanner.mjs`, `ru-scanner.mjs`, `paths.mjs`). **No production-code change.** Suite 1084 → 1086.

---



## [1.69.1] — 2026-06-12

**fix(scan): raise the `#/scan` result display cap 500 → 2000 per region so large regional sweeps are no longer silently truncated.** A real RU scan produced **1352** matching jobs, but only the first **500** were stored in `data/last-scan.json` and rendered in the results table — **852 relevant jobs were hidden** (the `2000 scanned → ~600 shown` symptom: 139 EN + 500 RU). Both `server/lib/en-scanner.mjs` and `server/lib/ru-scanner.mjs` now cap the stored `filtered` set at a shared, env-overridable constant `MAX_STORED_RESULTS` (default **2000**, override via `SCAN_MAX_RESULTS`). This is **display-only** — appending to `pipeline.md` and `scan-history.tsv` already used the uncapped `fresh` (new-since-last-scan) set and was never truncated. New `tests/scan-result-cap.test.mjs` (3 cases) locks the default, the env override, and that neither scanner hard-codes `slice(0, 500)`.

**fix(health/ui): `#/health` check cards no longer overflow.** A long check name/value (e.g. `PROFILE CUSTOMIZED · still on template …`, `PLAYWRIGHT (PARENT NODE_MODULES)`) collided with the right-hand **Fix →** button + status badge and spilled out of the card, because the generic `.flex-between` flex children default to `min-width: auto` and never shrink. The row is now tagged `.health-check-row` with scoped CSS: the left text shrinks + wraps (`min-width: 0`), the action group keeps its size (`flex: 0 0 auto`) and wraps below on narrow cards. New `tests/health-card-overflow.test.mjs` (2 cases). Suite 1079 → 1084.

---



## [1.69.0] — 2026-06-12

**feat(scan): P-14 plug-in scanner auto-discovery — drop a `.mjs` in `server/lib/sources/` to register a new source.** Pre-v1.69 the source list in `server/lib/sources/registry.mjs` was a static hand-maintained array — adding a new adapter required editing both `<id>.mjs` AND `registry.mjs`. Closes the `partial` half of the roadmap item P-14 (`docs/ROADMAP.md`). Now every `*.mjs` in `server/lib/sources/` is auto-loaded at module boot; each adapter contributes its identity via a self-describing `export const meta = { value, label, region, configKey? }` block. The 12 shipped adapters (ashby / greenhouse / lever / rss / smartrecruiters / workable / workday + geekjob / getmatch / habr / hh / trudvsem) each grew a `meta` export; `registry.mjs` now uses `readdirSync` + dynamic `import()` resolved at module-eval via top-level await (Node 18+ ESM standard). The public API (`SOURCES`, `SOURCES_BY_REGION`, `RU_CONFIG_KEYS`, `getRegionalSources`) is unchanged — every existing import keeps working. Validation rejects malformed `meta` (missing `value`/`label`/`region`, RU without `configKey`, region outside `'en'|'ru'`) and logs a single `console.warn` per offending file so half-migrated branches stay diagnostic-friendly. The bundled `registry.mjs` is excluded from self-import. New `tests/sources-registry-discovery.test.mjs` adds 14 cases covering shipped-adapter coverage, drop-in adapter discovery, helper-module skip, malformed-meta rejection, self-import exclusion, missing-directory tolerance, and deterministic ordering. Suite 1065 → 1079.

---



## [1.68.2] — 2026-06-07

**fix(bin): `npx` / `npm link` CLI verbs were broken — resolve the bin path through symlinks.** npm and npx expose `career-ops-ui` as a symlink under `node_modules/.bin/`, where the old `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"` resolved to `.bin` instead of the package root — so `npx career-ops-ui init` ran `node node_modules/scripts/init.mjs` and crashed with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` (local runs after `npm install` were unaffected, which hid the bug). Both `bin/career-ops-ui.sh` and `bin/start.sh` now canonicalize `SCRIPT_DIR` through the symlink chain (`readlink` loop + `cd -P`), so every verb works from the repo, via `npm link`, and via `npx`. Adds a regression lock in `tests/sh-files.test.mjs` that runs a verb through a `.bin`-style symlink. Suite 1065/1065.

---



## [1.68.1] — 2026-05-29

**fix(scan): per-source fetch timeout 10s → 60s.** v1.67.1's 10s fail-fast also cut off slow-but-alive Ashby boards that just needed more time. Raise the default to one minute so those return. Trade-off: a genuinely dead/hung source now holds a concurrency slot for the full 60s (slower worst-case scan), and the chronic hangers (Perplexity, Supabase, Resend, …) likely still time out — a per-source / lower-Ashby-concurrency fix would address those properly. Override with `SCAN_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`. Suite 1063/1063.

---



## [1.68.0] — 2026-05-29

**feat(scan): reworked the result-filter panel — labelled fields, an Apply button, an On-site option, and a working salary filter.** Every filter on `#/scan` is now a labelled field (label **above** the control, not a placeholder): Search · Work type · Salary from · Salary to · Source · Scope. An explicit **Apply** button (plus **Reset**, and Enter in any field) re-runs the filter; an on-page hint explains how it works. **The salary range now actually filters** — once you set a *from*/*to* value, jobs whose listed pay falls outside the range **and jobs with no listed salary at all** are dropped (overlapping-range match; currency ignored). The Work type filter gains an **On-site** option alongside Remote / Hybrid / Relocation. New i18n keys ×9; `salaryInRange` made strict; suite 1063/1063.

---



## [1.67.1] — 2026-05-29

**fix(scan): per-source fetch timeout 30s → 10s (fail-fast).** v1.67.0's 30s raise recovered only ~half the slow Ashby boards; the rest (Perplexity, Supabase, Resend, DeepL, Ramp, …) hang regardless of the deadline, so a longer timeout just stalled every scan waiting on dead slots. 10s fails fast on the chronic hangers and keeps scans responsive. Override with `SCAN_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`. Suite 1060/1060.

---



## [1.67.0] — 2026-05-29

**feat(scan): salary range filter (from / to) on `#/scan`, plus a longer per-source fetch timeout.** The results table gains two numeric inputs — salary **from** / **to** — beside the text and remote filters. Each row's free-text salary (`от 100 000 до 200 000 ₽`, `120000-150000 USD`, `$120K–$150K`, …) is parsed to a numeric range and matched with overlapping-range semantics; rows with no published salary are kept, so the filter narrows the list instead of gutting it (comparison is currency-agnostic — no FX conversion). Also **raises the per-source scan fetch timeout 15s → 30s** (override: `SCAN_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`) — Ashby's `includeCompensation` payloads routinely took >15s under 8-way concurrency, so ~30 Ashby boards were timing out every scan. New `window.Skills.parseSalaryRange`/`salaryInRange` + i18n ×9; 13 new tests; suite 1060/1060.

---



## [1.66.0] — 2026-05-28

**feat(scan): RU sources now walk ALL result pages, not just the first.** hh.ru, Habr Career and Trudvsem each only paged the first ~50 hits per query; they now follow pagination to the end — `&page=N` for hh.ru/Habr, `offset`/`meta.total` for Trudvsem — deduping across pages and stopping when a page adds nothing new (or at a 50-page safety cap). A query like "Backend разработчик" now returns the full result set instead of one page (e.g. hh.ru PHP 17 → 55+ across 3 pages; Trudvsem returns all 72). Per-page fetches keep the existing timeout + AbortSignal. 4 new tests; suite 1045/1045.

---



## [1.65.0] — 2026-05-28

**feat(scan): hh.ru is now scraped from its public website instead of the JSON API — works from any IP, no proxy.** `api.hh.ru` started returning a bare `403 forbidden` to every programmatic client regardless of IP (US, RU datacenter, RU residential, RU mobile) or User-Agent — an edge anti-bot block, not a documented API error. The website (`hh.ru/search/vacancy`) still serves full server-rendered results to any browser-like client, so the adapter now parses that HTML (like Habr Career). **Removes the `HH_PROXY` env added in 1.64.0 and the `undici` dependency** — no proxy, key, or User-Agent setup needed. Tests rewritten for the HTML parser; suite 1041/1041.

---



## [1.64.0] — 2026-05-27

**feat(scan): route the hh.ru request through a Russian proxy via `HH_PROXY`.** hh.ru geo-blocks its API by **IP**, not User-Agent — so `HH_USER_AGENT` alone never lifted a 403 from a non-RU exit node. Set `HH_PROXY` to a Russian HTTP/HTTPS proxy URL (e.g. `http://user:pass@ru-host:port`) and **only** the hh.ru request is routed through it; every other source keeps its direct connection. Built on `undici`'s `ProxyAgent` (new runtime dep); the dispatcher is omitted entirely when `HH_PROXY` is unset, and a changed value is picked up on restart. 3 new tests; suite 1041/1041.

---



## [1.63.2] — 2026-05-27

**feat(scan): live % progress + per-source detail in the `#/scan` console.** The progress bar is now **determinate** — scanners emit progress events (EN: per company; RU: per query) forwarded over SSE, and the bar fills with a live **"Scanning… NN%"** label (animated indeterminate stripe only until the first event). Each source's first failure (timeout / 403 / network) is now logged to the console in detail (e.g. `⚠ hh timed out: …`), then repeats are suppressed. 1 new test; suite 1040/1040.

---



## [1.63.1] — 2026-05-27

**style(scan): make the `#/scan` progress bar more prominent.** Wrapped the in-flight indicator with a visible **"Scanning…"** caption and bumped the bar to **8px** (was a thin 4px) so it's clearly noticeable while a scan runs. No behavior change.

## [1.63.0] — 2026-05-27

**feat(scan): per-request fetch timeout + `#/scan` progress bar.** Scanner source requests had no deadline, so a stalled upstream (e.g. `api.hh.ru` from a blocked IP) could **hang the whole scan**. A new `server/lib/fetch-timeout.mjs` wraps the scanners' `fetchImpl` (`makeTimeoutFetch`, default **15s**, override via `SCAN_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`) so every source request has a hard deadline — a timed-out source is recorded as a non-fatal error and the scan continues (Habr keeps working even when hh.ru is unreachable). The `#/scan` page also shows an indeterminate progress bar while a scan is in flight (localized `scan.progress` across all 9 locales). 7 new tests; suite 1039/1039.

---



## [1.62.3] — 2026-05-27

**docs: clarify install (career-ops-ui runs inside `career-ops/web-ui/`) + `init` troubleshooting, across all 9 locales.** Rewrote the install section into **Option 1** (one curl) / **Option 2** (clone the UI *inside* an existing career-ops project as `web-ui`) + CLI verbs + provider setup + a **Troubleshooting `init`** block — addressing the common confusion of cloning career-ops-ui standalone and running `init` without the parent project. Also added the nested-layout note to the `/help` §1 Setup section and summarized the whole v1.62.* line in the README highlight. Docs-only; no code change.

---



## [1.62.2] — 2026-05-27

**fix(help): `#/help` filter is now full-text (finds H3 subsections like RSS).** The help-page search/TOC filter previously matched only H2 section titles, so the v1.62.x RSS docs (an H3 under §5 Portals & sources) weren't findable. Each section's body text is now indexed into the filter, so searching e.g. "RSS" surfaces §5. Pure client-side; no API change.

---



## [1.62.1] — 2026-05-27

**feat(scan): RSS in the source filter + RSS location fix.** The `#/scan` source-filter dropdown now lists **RSS** (added to `server/lib/sources/registry.mjs` + the SPA fallback list), so RSS-board results (LaraJobs, WeWorkRemotely, …) are filterable like any ATS source. The RSS adapter no longer maps the feed `<category>` tag onto `location` — non-location tags there made `location_filter` wrongly drop remote roles; `location` is now empty so feeds pass location filtering. Scan-button tooltips/labels and the source-list i18n string (`dash.quick.scanSub`) updated across all 9 locales to include Workable / SmartRecruiters / Workday / RSS. i18n snapshot + scan-sources endpoint test (6 → 7 EN sources) updated.

---



## [1.62.0] — 2026-05-27

**feat(scan): generic RSS adapter for non-ATS job boards.** A new `rss` portal adapter (`server/lib/portals/adapters/rss.mjs` + `server/lib/sources/rss.mjs`) lets the scanner pull jobs from any RSS feed — LaraJobs, WeWorkRemotely, RemoteOK, golangprojects and other boards outside Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever. Zero new dependencies: feed parsing is regex-based with CDATA + HTML-entity support (titles/companies are tag-stripped, astral code points decoded safely). Activated per-company via `provider: rss` / `rss:` / `feed_url:` in `portals.yml`, so it never intercepts ATS-matched companies. `ALL_ADAPTERS` grows 6 → 7. 29 new tests; documented across all 9 README locales.

---



## [1.61.1] — 2026-05-22

**fix(i18n): localize the theme-toggle title + aria-label across all 9 locales (MINOR-001).** The dark/light theme button (`#theme-toggle`) hardcoded `title="Toggle theme"` and `aria-label="Toggle theme"` in `index.html` — the tooltip and screen-reader text never translated, on any locale. A new `top.themeToggle` key + a `data-i18n-title` handler in `applyI18n()` (mirroring the v1.58.15 search-aria-label fix) localize both attributes on boot and on every language switch. Locked by `tests/playwright-theme-toggle-i18n.mjs` (9 locales + runtime-switch) and two static guards in `tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs`. The lone LOW finding from the v1.61.0 French sign-off. (MINOR-001)

---



## [1.61.0] — 2026-05-22

**feat(i18n): add French as the 9th UI language.** New per-locale dictionary `public/js/lib/locales/i18n-dict.fr.js` (`window.__I18N_DICT_FR`), at full **668-key** parity with English; new help bundle `docs/help/fr.md` (**19 H2 / 73 H3**, exact structural parity with `en`). `fr` is registered in the language switcher and browser auto-detect (`i18n.js`), the assembler (`i18n-dict.js`), `index.html` (a `<script>` tag before the assembler), the test snapshot, and every test locale list. The initial translation table came from **PR #9** (community contribution). No logic change: `t()` and every view are unchanged. **1001 / 1001** unit tests; the Playwright locale-sweep grows to 9 subtests. (FR-LOCALE)

---



## [1.60.0] — 2026-05-22

**refactor(i18n): split the 8-column megafile into per-locale files (I18N-SPLIT).** The translation dictionary lived in one 849-line `public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js` (key → { en, es, … } across 8 locales). It is now **one file per locale** — `public/js/lib/locales/i18n-dict.{en,es,pt-BR,ko,ja,ru,zh-CN,zh-TW}.js` (each assigns `window.__I18N_DICT_<LANG> = { key: string }`) plus a shared `i18n-dict.aliases.js` — so a translator edits a single language in isolation (the i18next / OpenWA layout). `i18n-dict.js` is now a small **assembler** that merges the per-locale tables back into the exact same `window.__I18N_DICT` shape, so `t()`, every view, and every call-site are byte-for-byte unchanged. Everything loads synchronously via `<script src>` — **no build step, no runtime fetch** (both hard rules preserved). A captured snapshot proves the migration is lossless (assembled dict ≡ pre-split dict, 678 keys). Tooling + tests made split-aware via a shared `tests/helpers/i18n-vm.mjs`: `tools/i18n-audit.mjs`, the CI inline coverage check (which had silently become a no-op against the post-v1.23 split — it now actually loads the dictionary), and ~25 dictionary tests. New `tests/i18n-locale-files.test.mjs` (snapshot equality · per-locale key parity · alias integrity · index.html load order) and `tests/playwright-locale-sweep.mjs` (every page × 8 locales renders + localizes in real Chromium). 994 → **1000** unit · 62 → **70** Playwright. No user-facing behaviour change. (I18N-SPLIT)

---



## [1.59.13] — 2026-05-21

**fix(i18n): collapse TRUE duplicate keys via @alias + final personal-data purge (pre-fr, follow-up to v1.59.12).** Two parts. **(1) Personal data:** swept the WHOLE repo, not just the dict — the maintainer's real name was used as incidental test-fixture data (`tests/health-doctor-unify.test.mjs`, `tests/llm-output.test.mjs`) and in archived QA reports; all replaced with neutral examples (`Jane Doe`). `LICENSE` copyright + `package.json` author switched from the real legal name to the public `Fighter90` handle. Repo now greps clean for the real name/email everywhere. **(2) Duplicate keys (I18N-CL3, properly):** added an `@alias` mechanism to `i18n.t()` — a key `{ '@alias': 'x.y' }` resolves to a canonical key. Collapsed the 10 keys that are byte-identical across all 8 locales (`nav.help`/`dash.quick.helpCta` → `help.title`; `nav.cv` → `cv.title`; `nav.health`/`dash.quick.healthCta` → `health.title`; `nav.reports`/`dash.reports`/`dash.quick.reportsCta` → `rep.title`; `nav.apply` → `apply.title`; `nav.interviewPrep` → `interviewPrep.title`). The contributor's own `nav.config`/`config.title` example is deliberately NOT aliased — they diverge in Spanish (short sidebar `Configuración` vs full title `Configuración de la aplicación`); aliasing would change a rendered label. Coverage test, CI inline check, and `tools/i18n-audit.mjs` are all alias-aware (skip alias keys for parity, enforce every target exists, resolve before dup-counting). New `tests/i18n-alias.test.mjs` (3 cases) locks integrity + behaviour. 991 → **994** unit. Reduces the French translator's surface — true dupes are now translated once. (I18N-CL3, personal-data-sweep)

## [1.59.12] — 2026-05-21

**fix(i18n): i18n-dict.js cleanup — pre-fr ship (I18N-CL1, I18N-CL2, I18N-CL4).** External French-locale contributor audit. **I18N-CL1 (privacy):** `training.coursePh` carried a vendor-specific cert name across all 8 locales — replaced with a neutral generic placeholder (`Cloud architecture certification` + native equivalents). **I18N-CL2 (hygiene):** the `followup.lastPh` dict fallback was a frozen `2026-04-21` literal — replaced with a localized format hint (`YYYY-MM-DD` / `AAAA-MM-DD` / `ГГГГ-ММ-ДД`); the live dynamic `today − 14d` placeholder (U-3, v1.58.23) in `mode-page.js` was already working and is now lock-tested. **I18N-CL4 (audit):** new `tools/i18n-audit.mjs` + `npm run audit:i18n`, wired into CI — hard-fails on personal data, locale-parity gaps, empty values, and bare-calendar-date placeholders. **I18N-CL3 (decision):** the ~50 duplicate-value key groups (e.g. `nav.scan` / `scan.btnRun` / `scan.col.company`) are intentional — distinct UI roles that non-English locales translate differently; deduping them would remove i18n flexibility, so they are reported as informational warnings, not failures (documented in the dict header). 3 new tests (988 → **991** unit). Unblocks the upcoming French locale PR. (I18N-CL1, I18N-CL2, I18N-CL4)

---



## [1.59.11] — 2026-05-21

**fix(test): v1.59.11 — e2e-comprehensive 12-case CI failure root-caused and closed.** Twelve cases (Pipeline · Activity · Health · 7 Mode pages · 404 · Profile) had been failing on every CI run going back to v1.58.x because `page.goto(baseUrl + '/#/X')` is a no-op for hash-only URL changes in Playwright. Once the CV-save step set the hash to `#/cv`, every subsequent `goto` to a hash route silently kept the page on `#/cv` — Activity/Health/Mode/Profile selectors never matched, and the 4 'pass' results in between were vacuous (their assertions found CV's elements). Fix in [tests/e2e-comprehensive.mjs](tests/e2e-comprehensive.mjs): new `goRoute(hash)` helper that bounces through `about:blank` before each `goto`, forcing a real navigation and SPA re-bootstrap. All 17 `page.goto(`${baseUrl}/#/...`)` call sites replaced. Diagnostic instrumentation (`E2E_DUMP_ON_FAIL=1` env var) added for future investigations. Result: **23 / 23 cases green** locally · 988 / 988 unit · 20 / 20 smoke e2e. (e2e-harness-r1)

---



## [1.59.10] — 2026-05-21

**fix(api): NEW-F1-sub-r1 (v1.59.10) — un-encoded `../` traversal guard hoisted above all /api route registrations.** v1.59.8 added a `req.originalUrl.includes('..')` middleware, but it was placed AFTER `app.all('/api/*', JSON-404)` AND AFTER all route handlers — by which time Express had already normalised the URL (collapsing `..` segments). `/api/jds/../../../etc/passwd` was rewritten to `/etc/passwd` and fell through to the SPA static handler (200 OK on `index.html`). v1.59.10 hoists the guard to the TOP of [server/index.mjs](server/index.mjs) `createApp()` (above every `register*Routes(app)` call) so it inspects the verbatim request URL before any normalisation. Pattern: `/^\/api(\/|$)/.test(req.originalUrl) && /\.\.\//.test(req.originalUrl)`. New [tests/api-path-traversal.test.mjs](tests/api-path-traversal.test.mjs) — 6 cases driving the real http module (Node's fetch normalises `..` client-side, so we drop to `http.request` with a verbatim path). Unknown `/api/*` paths still return `{error: 'unknown api'}` from the existing `app.all` fallback. 982 → **988** unit. (NEW-F1-sub-r1)

---



## [1.59.9] — 2026-05-21

**fix(ux): UX-A5-r4 (v1.59.9) — Help TOC scroll-spy debug marker + behavioural lock-test.** Sixth-cycle closure: previous five attempts (v1.58.45 / v1.58.52 / v1.59.0 / v1.59.3 / v1.59.8) all shipped with passing static tests but the bug stayed open because the tests asserted source-shape, not behaviour. v1.59.9 fixes the gap: (1) `<body data-toc-spy="active">` debug marker — single selector any tester can use to answer "is the spy alive?" without needing to scroll; (2) synchronous initial paint at mount tail covers the router-pre-paints-view case; (3) double-rAF re-compute covers the route-handler-returns-before-router-appends case; (4) resize listener subscribed so viewport-flip mid-scroll re-paints; (5) cleanup removes BOTH listeners and the marker on hashchange. [public/js/views/help.js](public/js/views/help.js) algorithm: linear scan with `else break;` short-circuit (O(active-index) per scroll event). New [tests/help-toc-spy-behavior.test.mjs](tests/help-toc-spy-behavior.test.mjs) runs the algorithm against 6 synthetic-geometry scenarios + 1 algorithm-parity check against help.js source — the test fails if the algorithm regresses, before any browser run. 973 → **982** unit. (UX-A5-r4)

---



## [1.59.8] — 2026-05-21

**fix(ux+api): v1.59.8 — UX-A5-r3 + NEW-F1-sub (HIGH + LOW bundled per FIX-PROMPT-FINAL-CONSOLIDATED).** Doctrine-exception release: the 2026-05-20 FINAL REGRESSION-v1.59.7 report explicitly recommended bundling these two. UX-A5-r3 (HIGH) — after 4 ship attempts with IntersectionObserver all failed live verification, [public/js/views/help.js](public/js/views/help.js) replaces the IO entirely with a plain scroll listener. Root cause: with rootMargin -20%/-55% the trigger band ended at 45% of viewport, but scrollIntoView({block:'center'}) lands the target at 50% — JUST below the band end. The new scroll listener probes absolute heading positions every rAF, computes the heading whose top is at-or-above 30% of viewport, applies `.toc-current` — no band, no race, no mount-order gotcha. NEW-F1-sub (LOW) — [server/index.mjs](server/index.mjs) adds a late middleware that inspects `req.originalUrl` (not normalised `req.url`) and bounces any `/api`-prefixed request whose raw URL contains `..` as 404 JSON `{error: 'invalid path'}`. New `UX-A5-r3` lock-test + `NEW-F1-sub` static + behavioural guards in tests/. 971 → **973** unit. (UX-A5-r3 · NEW-F1-sub)

---



## [1.59.7] — 2026-05-20

**fix(api): NEW-D3-cache (v1.59.7) — `GET /api/cv` sends `Cache-Control: no-store`.** Matches the SPA-shell policy (W-001 / v1.54.7). `cv.md` is the user-edited primary artifact; a stale browser cache or intermediary proxy could surface yesterday's text and trick the editor into saving over the live version. No ETag dance — the file is small and the GET is rare. New test in [tests/api-404-json.test.mjs](tests/api-404-json.test.mjs) (the suite is the in-process server harness; named for its first test). 970 → **971** unit. (NEW-D3-cache)

---



## [1.59.6] — 2026-05-20

**feat(a11y): NEW-D2-motion (v1.59.6) — honour `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.** New `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block in [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css) neutralizes `animation-duration` + `transition-duration` to 0.01 ms and forces `scroll-behavior: auto` (so the Help TOC click-to-scroll lands instantly). WCAG 2.3.3 (AAA) — users with vestibular disorders, motion sensitivity, or simply OS-level reduced-motion preference now get an animation-free UI. Static guard in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs). 969 → **970** unit. (NEW-D2-motion)

---



## [1.59.5] — 2026-05-20

**fix(api): NEW-F1 (v1.59.5) — unknown `/api/*` returns JSON 404 on every verb.** Pre-fix `app.get("/api/*", …)` was GET-only; POST / PUT / DELETE to an unknown api path fell through to the SPA catch-all and returned an HTML 404, breaking SPA clients that do `try { res.json() } catch {}`. Changed to `app.all("/api/*", …)` in [server/index.mjs](server/index.mjs). New test suite [tests/api-404-json.test.mjs](tests/api-404-json.test.mjs) probes GET / POST / PUT / DELETE on `/api/no-such-endpoint` plus an unknown `:name` under a real handler — 5 new tests, all green. 964 → **969** unit. (NEW-F1)

---



## [1.59.4] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ui): NEW-OR1 (v1.59.4) — `#/config` API-keys summary chip is race-safe.** User-reported transient `Keys: 0 / 5` flash during Save flows. The previous `refreshApiSummary()` cleared `<span>` children before awaiting the network fetch; a concurrent `providers-changed` event could observe the empty state. New implementation in [public/js/views/config.js](public/js/views/config.js):\n\n1. Build new `<span>` nodes **before** any DOM mutation.\n2. Atomic swap via `apiSummary.replaceChildren(newActive, newCount)` — chip never blanks mid-update.\n3. `inFlight` token counter drops stale resolves when a newer refresh starts.\n4. `lastGoodSt` cache preserves the last known state when fetch returns null (network blip, server reload), so the chip never collapses to `0 / 5` on a transient empty response.\n\nLock-test in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs) asserts all four invariants. 963 → **964** unit. (NEW-OR1)

---



## [1.59.3] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-A5-r2 (v1.59.3) — Help TOC scroll-spy harden (third-pass fix).** Two real issues persisted after v1.58.52: (1) `rootMargin: "-30% 0% -60% 0%"` left only a 10% visible band so fast scroll could skip the trigger zone entirely and no IntersectionObserver entry ever fired; (2) no initial-state computation, so a freshly-loaded `#/help` with zero scroll showed zero highlights even though section 1 was visibly active. [public/js/views/help.js](public/js/views/help.js): widened `rootMargin` to `-20% 0% -55% 0%` (25% band), made `root: null` explicit, extracted `applyCurrent(id)` so the same code path serves both observer callbacks and the initial-state pass, and on mount picks the heading closest to 20% from top of viewport. 962 → **963** unit. (UX-A5-r2)

---



## [1.59.2] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ui): v1.59.2 — UX-A9 / UX-A3 chip count + overlap (post-v1.59.1 hotfix).** Three real bugs in the v1.58.62 / v1.58.55 chips, user-reported on the staging surface:\n\n1. **Always `Keys: 0 / 5`.** `/api/status/providers` returns `keysConfigured` as an **array** of provider names; pre-fix `typeof === number` was always false. Now uses `Array.isArray(st.keysConfigured) ? st.keysConfigured.length : 0`.\n2. **Lowercase provider name.** Server returns `anthropic` (not `claude` — `LLM_PROVIDER` env value vs resolved provider name); the NAME map was keyed by `claude:` so it always fell through to the lowercase fallback. Re-keyed `{anthropic, gemini, openai, qwen, openrouter}` in both [public/js/views/config.js](public/js/views/config.js) and [public/js/views/dashboard.js](public/js/views/dashboard.js).\n3. **Sticky chip overlapped other elements.** `.api-keys__summary` had `position: sticky` + `z-index: 5` and created a stacking context that floated above the tablist + page header on scroll. Dropped sticky — the chip is at the top of a short panel already. Lock-test updated to forbid the sticky position. (No version bump alone — counts on existing UX-A3 / UX-A9 lock-tests.) (post-cycle hotfix)

---



## [1.59.1] — 2026-05-20

**fix(test): v1.59.1 — NEW-D1 i18n-no-latin-leaks guard accepts UX-A11 polished ES copy.** During final verification of the v1.59.0 ship I caught a regression: the v1.58.37 NEW-D1 static guard asserted `pipe.title[es]` must match `/vacant|vaca/i` (locking the old `Pipeline de vacantes`). UX-A11 (v1.58.64) refined that to `Pipeline de candidaturas` (candidate-side perspective). Fix: relax the regex to `/vacant|vaca|candidatur/i` so either contextualizing noun passes. No production-code change. 962 unit tests, 0 fail.

---



## [1.59.0] — 2026-05-20

**feat(ui): UX-A14 (v1.59.0) — Mobile (≤ 420 px) media-query pass.** Closes the long-standing mobile audit. Five focused fixes inside a single `@media (max-width: 420px)` block in [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css):\n\n1. `.card-row` (4 dashboard metric cards) collapses to 1-up below 420 px (was a 900+ px horizontal scroll).\n2. `.dash-hero-cta` stacks vertically with full-width buttons (was side-by-side wrap-mid-label on iPhone SE).\n3. `.page-header` stacks H1+subtitle above the action buttons row (was right-side overflow on 360 px).\n4. `.qa-grid` minmax floor drops from 220 px to 160 px so tiles fit two-up on 360–390 px viewports.\n5. `.api-keys__summary` chips tighten horizontal padding for breathing room.\n\nRegression-lock test in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs). 961 → **962** unit. (UX-A14)

---



## [1.58.65] — 2026-05-20

**test(ui): UX-A2 (v1.58.65) — lock-test on Modes structured field-form.** The 5-field structured form for `#/config → Modes` was already shipped in v1.54.3 (canonical Target Roles / Adaptive Framing / Exit Narrative / Comp Targets / Location Policy + repeatable line-inputs for list-kind fields + × remove + add-row affordance + tagged `{mode: sections|markdown}` collect()). The UX-A2 audit assumed it was missing because all 5 sections initially appeared as `<textarea>` (an artifact of the field-form scaffolding pass before file load). This regression-lock test in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs) prevents a future PR from collapsing the field-form back to raw markdown. No code change. 960 → **961** unit. (UX-A2)

---



## [1.58.64] — 2026-05-20

**fix(i18n): UX-A11 (v1.58.64) — es / pt-BR copy polish: English loanwords replaced.** `eval.subtitle` (es) now uses ajuste del CV / Puntaje / cabecera / informe; pt-BR uses aderência do CV / Pontuação / cabeçalho / relatório. `pipe.title` (es) refined to Pipeline de candidaturas (candidate-side perspective). pt-BR vagas retained. 959 → **960** unit. (UX-A11)

---



## [1.58.63] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ui): UX-A15 (v1.58.63) — Dashboard Pipeline tile gets visual primary weight.** The Quick-actions grid previously gave every tile equal weight; the highest-frequency action (Pipeline) didn't draw the eye. The `qa()` helper in [public/js/views/dashboard.js](public/js/views/dashboard.js) now accepts a 7th `primary` flag; the Pipeline tile is the only one passing `true` so it gets a subtle accent border + larger icon + bolder label via `.qa-tile--primary` ([public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css)). Tile order, copy, click target, and accessibility name are unchanged. Lock-test in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs). 958 → **959** unit. (UX-A15)

---



## [1.58.62] — 2026-05-20

**feat(ui): UX-A9 (v1.58.62) — #/config → API keys panel sticky summary chip.** Before this release, with 5 provider key sections stacked vertically on the API-keys tab, the user had to scroll to know which provider the OR-fallback resolves to or how many keys were configured. [public/js/views/config.js](public/js/views/config.js) now renders a `position: sticky` `.api-keys__summary` at the top of the apiPanel showing `Active: <provider>` + `Keys: <count>/5`. Reuses `/api/status/providers` (no new API surface). Refreshes on `providers-changed` (after Save). Two new i18n keys (`config.activeProvider`, `config.keysConfiguredPrefix`) × 8 locales; one CSS rule (`.api-keys__summary`); static guard in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs). 957 → **958** unit. (UX-A9)

---



## [1.58.61] — 2026-05-20

**docs(readme): UX-A8 (v1.58.61) — first-run cleanup section added across all 8 READMEs.** Fresh clones of career-ops include two QA fixture URLs (`example.com/qa-fixture-*`) in `data/pipeline.md` so the test suite can run hermetically; the README never documented this so first-time users mistook them for real jobs. New `## First run — clean state` section (mirrored in es / pt-BR / ko / ja / ru / zh-CN / zh-TW) instructs `make clean-test-fixtures && npm start` before the first scan. Lock-test in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs) verifies all 8 READMEs reference `make clean-test-fixtures` and `qa-fixture-*`. 956 → **957** unit. (UX-A8)

---



## [1.58.60] — 2026-05-20

**feat(ui): UX-A12 (v1.58.60) — Notifications drawer Clear all + per-entry dismiss.** The v1.58.34 notifications journal capped at 50 entries but offered no manual purge. New `UI.clearToastHistory()` and `UI.dismissToastHistory(ts)` in [public/js/api.js](public/js/api.js) mutate `toastHistory` in place and notify subscribers with sentinel events (`{cleared: true}` / `{dismissed: ts}`); the drawer subscriber in [public/js/app.js](public/js/app.js) detects them, re-renders, and — critically — does NOT bump the unread counter on purges. Drawer head now carries a `Clear all` button (auto-hidden when the journal is empty); every `.notif-item` carries a `×` dismiss button. Three new i18n keys (`notif.clearAll`, `notif.clearAllAria`, `notif.dismiss`) × 8 locales; CSS for both controls; lock-test in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs). 955 → **956** unit. (UX-A12)

## [1.58.59] — 2026-05-20

**feat(ui): UX-A13 (v1.58.59) — actionable "Fix →" CTA on failing #/health rows.** Pre-fix the 21 health rows showed status only; a user with `Profile customized: FAIL` had to guess where to go. [public/js/views/health.js](public/js/views/health.js) now renders a small ghost-button `Fix →` next to the badge on failing/optional rows. Mapped targets: `Profile customized` → `#/config?tab=profile`, `cv.md non-empty` → `#/cv`, `portals.yml present` → `#/config?tab=portals`, `data/applications.md` → `#/tracker`. Any `*_API_KEY` or `LLM_PROVIDER*` row routes to `#/config?tab=api-keys` via regex fallback. Unmapped failures stay action-less (no dead-end CTAs). Two new i18n keys (`health.fix`, `health.fixAria`) × 8 locales. 954 → **955** unit. (UX-A13)

## [1.58.58] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-A10 (v1.58.58) — guard #/cv against leaving with unsaved buffer.** Pre-fix, navigating away from #/cv with unsaved edits silently dropped the buffer. [public/js/views/cv.js](public/js/views/cv.js) now registers a `beforeunload` listener (browser-close confirm — generic dialog per modern browser policy) **and** a `hashchange` listener (SPA-internal nav prompts via localized `window.confirm()` and rewinds the hash if the user cancels). `cvDirty` lives in the save-button IIFE closure; cleanup self-detaches when the hash leaves `#/cv` (M-1 discipline). One new i18n key (`cv.unsavedConfirm`) × 8 locales. 953 → **954** unit. (UX-A10)

## [1.58.57] — 2026-05-20

**test(ui): UX-A7 (v1.58.57) — lock-test on the cost-line auto-refresh contract.** v1.58.41 (UX-D-I) wired `UI.providerCostHint` to refresh when the user changes `LLM_PROVIDER` mid-session, but the contract had no static guard — any of the three pieces (config.js dispatch, api.js subscribe, advisor-view call site) could regress silently and the cost line would lie. New regression test in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs) locks all three: (1) `config.js` Save handler dispatches `providers-changed`, (2) `UI.providerCostHint` subscribes via `document.addEventListener`, (3) all 4 advisor views (`#/deep`, `#/evaluate`, `#/auto`, `#/<mode>`) call `UI.providerCostHint(t)`. 952 → **953** unit. (UX-A7)

---



## [1.58.56] — 2026-05-20

**fix(a11y): UX-A4 (v1.58.56) — `.lang-btn` meets WCAG 2.5.8 minimum touch-target.** Pre-fix the language buttons in the sidebar footer measured 23–25 px tall × 47–72 px wide (below the 24×24 WCAG 2.5.8 / WCAG 2.2 AA floor). [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css) now declares `min-height: 28px` + `min-width: 28px` + `padding: 6px 10px` on `.lang-btn` — every locale label clears the floor with comfortable margin. Sidebar grows by 6 px total (negligible). Lock-test in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs). 951 → **952** unit. (UX-A4)

---



## [1.58.55] — 2026-05-20

**feat(ui): UX-A3 (v1.58.55) — Dashboard active-provider chip.** Above-the-fold chip in [public/js/views/dashboard.js](public/js/views/dashboard.js) hero now surfaces whether the OR-model fell through to a live provider (e.g. `⚡ Live evals: Anthropic claude-sonnet-4-6`) or whether the user is in `📋 Manual prompt mode (no API key set)`. Re-fetches on `providers-changed` (dispatched by [#/config](public/js/views/config.js) save) and on `visibilitychange` (cross-tab refocus). Reuses the existing `/api/status/providers` endpoint (no new API surface). Two i18n keys × 8 locales (`dash.provider.live`, `dash.provider.manual`); one CSS rule (`.dash-chip--provider`). Lifecycle cleanup on `hashchange` away from `#/dashboard` so listeners don't stack across navigation (M-1 discipline). 950 → **951** unit. (UX-A3)

---



## [1.58.54] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-A1 (v1.58.54) — defensive Deep-brief structure warning.** The canonical Deep-research brief promised in [career-ops.org/docs](https://career-ops.org/docs/introduction/guides/scan-job-portals) has six H2 sections (Company snapshot / Engineering culture / Recent news / Glassdoor / Interview process / Negotiation leverage). When the upstream prompt drifts and the saved brief is meta-narration instead of the final form, [public/js/views/deep.js](public/js/views/deep.js) now detects the regression (≥3 of the six H2s missing) and prepends a non-blocking `.brief-warning` card explaining what the brief should look like and linking to the canonical reference. The root prompt-layer fix lives in the parent project (`modes/deep.md`, blocked from here); this UI guardrail surfaces the drift instead of silently rendering a degenerate brief. CSS rule added to [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css); three new i18n keys (`deep.briefUnstructured.title` / `.body` / `deep.docsLink`) cover all 8 locales. New static guard in [tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs](tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs). 949 → **950** unit. (UX-A1)

---



## [1.58.53] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-A6 (NEW-M4-r1) — every saved-research card flows through a single `renderSavedCard()` helper.** v1.58.51 verification regression observed: one card rendered with no structural children (title+date as a single concatenated text node — `software-engineer-generalyesterday`) while another rendered with the proper `<span>` + `<time>` shape — depending on whether the card was page-load-rendered or runtime-inserted. Fix in [public/js/views/deep.js](public/js/views/deep.js#L26-L75): extracted `renderSavedCard(f)` that always emits `.saved-card__title` + `.saved-card__date datetime=…`. Whatever render path inserts a card (page-load `renderArchive`, post-`Run live`, or future code paths) routes through this single helper — the M-4 v1.58.11 flex-gap layout only works with the structural children present. 948 → **949** unit. (UX-A6)

---

## [1.58.52] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-A5 (NEW-K1) — `#/help` TOC scroll-spy actually fires now (regression from v1.58.45).** v1.58.51 verification regression caught: 18 H2 elements with ids, 18 TOC `<a>` links, but **0** links ever received `.toc-current` after scroll. Root cause: v1.58.45 wired the observer inside a `setTimeout(0)` that fired BEFORE the router appended the view to `#content`; `document.querySelectorAll(".help-article h2[id]")` matched nothing. Fix in [public/js/views/help.js](public/js/views/help.js#L155-L200): new `mountTocSpy()` observes the **synchronously-built `headings` refs** we already hold (no document re-query); deferred via **double `requestAnimationFrame`** so it fires after the first paint that includes the mounted view. 947 → **948** unit. (UX-A5)

## [1.58.51] — 2026-05-20

**chore(docs): v1.58.51 — final housekeeping wrap of the v1.58.37 → v1.58.50 cycle (14 single-fix releases).** No code or behavior changes; consolidation of the qa/ tree, doc currency, and the two lessons learned from this cycle. **(1) qa/ reorg:** all the version-locked source documents — `FIX-PROMPT-CONSOLIDATED.md`, `FIX-PROMPT-FINAL-EXHAUSTIVE.md`, `FIX-PROMPT-v1.58.37_and_beyond.md`, plus 6 root-level session snapshots (`MASTER-REGRESSION.md`, `2026-05-19-*.md`, `career-ops_*.md`, `FIX-PROMPT-v1.58.3.md`, `FIX-PROMPT-v1.58.4_and_beyond.md`) — moved into `qa/archive/v158-cycle/`. `qa/` root now contains exactly the **6 canonical perennial** documents: `README.md`, `REGRESSION-FINAL.md`, `UX-AUDIT-PROMPT.md`, `FUNCTIONALITY-CHECK.md`, `DESIGNER-EXPORT-PROMPT.md`, `G-005-closure-kit.md`. **(2) `qa/REGRESSION-FINAL.md` §13** documents every v1.58.37 → v1.58.50 invariant with its lock-test, organized by class (i18n / a11y / UX feedback / orientation / content fidelity / labels / tooling / docs) + 2 new "lessons captured" entries (markdown-bolded regex pitfall; Publish-runs-tests-against-tagged-ref pitfall). **(3) `qa/UX-AUDIT-PROMPT.md`** baseline table extended with the 14 new closed-in rows. **(4) `CLAUDE.md`** currency lifted (1.58.51, baseline 947/947). **(5) `.claude/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`** repo-state + test baseline lifted. **(6) `docs/ROADMAP.md`** chain end now at v1.58.51 / Net 947. **(7) `README ×8`** badges and content sync. Test baseline at v1.58.51: **947** unit (unchanged structurally) · 62 Playwright · 20 smoke · 23 comprehensive E2E. Also fixes the v1.58.48 / v1.58.50 Publish-failure pattern — by tagging at the same commit where ALL tests pass (instead of follow-up patches landing only on `main`). (housekeeping)

---

## [1.58.50] — 2026-05-20

**docs: DOC-1 — qa/REGRESSION-FINAL.md gets §5a documenting server error bodies as English-by-policy.** v1.58.36 audit raised NEW-D4: every server 4xx body is English on every locale. Two paths: (A) confirm by-design, document the contract; (B) read `Accept-Language` and localize. The spec recommended A — closing NEW-D4 as `not-a-finding` is least disruption and keeps tests stable. New [qa/REGRESSION-FINAL.md](qa/REGRESSION-FINAL.md) §5a section explains: server JSON error bodies stay English (debuggability boundary — bug reports paste cleanly, CI fixtures stay stable, server tests don't need parallel locale strings). The SPA wraps responses with localized chrome (toast colour, U-4 `Details` summary). `Accept-Language` is intentionally not read; the SPA-side `lang` is stripped before `validateConfig` per the v1.57.2 invariant. v1.59 option B (localized server errors with `{ error, error_en, code }`) is the future gate. 946 → **947** unit. **Closes the v1.58.37 → v1.58.50 queue from FIX-PROMPT-FINAL-EXHAUSTIVE.md** — 14 single-fix releases shipped, every one CI-green + AI-review LGTM. (DOC-1)

## [1.58.49] — 2026-05-20

**chore(tooling): TOOL-1 — `make clean-test-fixtures` + `scripts/clean-test-fixtures.mjs`.** v1.58.36 audit: `${CAREER_OPS_ROOT}/data/pipeline.md` had accumulated 1252+ `example.com/job/<n>` lines from regression runs. Manual cleanup was tedious. New [scripts/clean-test-fixtures.mjs](scripts/clean-test-fixtures.mjs) reads `${CAREER_OPS_ROOT or ..}/data/pipeline.md`, drops every line containing `example.com` (case-insensitive), preserves real ATS URLs verbatim, prints the count, and exits 0. `--dry-run` flag prints the would-be result to stdout without touching the file. New [Makefile](Makefile) with `make clean-test-fixtures` and `make clean-test-fixtures-dry-run` targets. 4 new CI-isolated tests in [tests/clean-test-fixtures.test.mjs](tests/clean-test-fixtures.test.mjs) (uses `mkdtempSync` for a synthetic parent — no real-file writes). 942 → **946** unit (4 new TOOL-1 cases). (TOOL-1)

---

## [1.58.48] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux/onboarding): UX-D-B — `#/dashboard` shows a global warning banner when the user is still on the default fixture profile.** v1.58.36 audit: `/api/health` already includes a `{ name: "Profile customized", ok: false }` row (server checks for `Acceptance Test` / `Jane Smith` / other template names in `server/lib/store.mjs`), but the user only saw it after navigating to `#/health`. Meanwhile every advisor output (Apply / Followup / Contacto / Deep) was addressed to the fixture name — broken first impression. New `profileFixtureBanner()` in [public/js/views/dashboard.js](public/js/views/dashboard.js) renders a `.hero-banner.hero-banner--warning` at the top of the route when the check fails, with localized message (`onboarding.fixtureWarning` × 8) + a CTA button linking to `#/config` (`onboarding.fixProfile` × 8). When the user replaces the fixture, /api/health flips `ok: true` and the next dashboard mount silently omits the banner. New CSS `.hero-banner` + `.hero-banner--warning` rules. 941 → **942** unit. (UX-D-B)

---

## [1.58.47] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux/naming): UX-D-C — top-bar `Quick scan` renamed to `Open Scan` so the label matches the actual behavior.** v1.58.36 audit: "Quick scan" implied an instant scan with sensible defaults, but the click handler at [public/js/app.js](public/js/app.js#L140) only navigates to `#/scan` — no scan starts. Renamed via the `top.quickscan` i18n key in all 8 locales (en `Open Scan` / es `Abrir Scan` / pt-BR `Abrir Scan` / ko `Scan 열기` / ja `Scan を開く` / ru `Открыть Scan` / zh-CN `打开 Scan` / zh-TW `開啟 Scan`). HTML default text in `index.html` updated to match. Behavior unchanged; only the label honesty improved. 940 → **941** unit. (UX-D-C)

---

## [1.58.46] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-D-D — `#/apply` checklist substitutes `{company}-{role}` with slugs derived from the URL/JD.** v1.58.36 audit: the generated checklist's item 5 read `Save filled answers to interview-prep/{company}-{role}.md before submitting.` — the literal `{company}-{role}` placeholders were displayed verbatim and the user had to mentally substitute (or, worse, paste them as-is). New `extractSlugs(url, jd)` + `substitutePlaceholders(text, url, jd)` in [public/js/views/apply.js](public/js/views/apply.js#L36-L93): the host whitelist (`greenhouse / lever / ashby / workable / smartrecruiters / workday`) picks `company` out of the URL path or subdomain, then derives `role` from the trailing path slug (stripped of trailing numeric IDs) — or, as fallback, from the JD's first line. If extraction fails (unknown host / no JD), placeholders become `[company]` / `[role]` (square-bracket convention for "fill in"). Substitution runs once before `parseChecklist`, so the live checklist + Copy-unchecked output stay coherent. 939 → **940** unit. (UX-D-D)

---

## [1.58.45] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-D-K — `#/help` TOC scroll-spy highlights the current section.** v1.58.36 audit: as the user scrolled the help body, the TOC sidebar (sticky, ~92 H2 sections) didn't indicate which section they were reading — they had to mentally scan the H2 above the fold against the TOC. New `IntersectionObserver` in [public/js/views/help.js](public/js/views/help.js#L155-L185) observes every `.help-article h2[id]` and applies `.toc-current` to the matching TOC `<a>` link when the H2 enters the upper-third reading band (`rootMargin: "-30% 0% -60% 0%"`). CSS [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css) gives `.toc-current` a brand-red left-border + `var(--rausch)` color + `font-weight: 600` so the active item reads at a glance. The observer is torn down on hashchange next to the existing scroll listener, so no observer leaks when the user leaves `#/help`. 938 → **939** unit. (UX-D-K)

---

## [1.58.44] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-D-L — `#/deep` opened Saved-research brief now has an inline × close button.** v1.58.36 audit: clicking a saved-research card on `#/deep` rendered the brief body inline (Copy / Download / Open in tab / Generate PDF buttons in the header) but the user had no way to **close** the brief without scrolling away or navigating. New `×` button in [public/js/views/deep.js](public/js/views/deep.js) `showResult()` header — clears `out.innerHTML`, mirrors the modal-close pattern (api.js UI.modal × button), keyboard-reachable, aria-label + title from new `deep.closeBrief` i18n key × 8. 937 → **938** unit. (UX-D-L)

---

## [1.58.43] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-D-F — `#/evaluate` empty-JD submit now shows a distinct localized error toast (was "JD too short").** Before the fix, clicking Evaluate with an empty textarea fell through to the existing `<50 chars` check and yielded `JD too short (min 50 chars)` — accurate but unhelpful: the real problem is "you typed nothing", not "you typed too little". [public/js/views/evaluate.js](public/js/views/evaluate.js#L28-L45) now checks `!jd` first and surfaces a new `eval.emptyJd` error toast (`"JD is required — paste the full job description"`, localized × 8) + focuses the textarea so the user can start typing immediately. The pre-existing `eval.shortJd` toast still fires for 1–49 char input. 936 → **937** unit. (UX-D-F)

---

## [1.58.42] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): UX-D-J — per-advisor ETA chip parity with `#/auto` (UX-6 v1.55.4).** v1.58.36 audit: only `#/auto` showed an honest "⏱ ~1–2 min" chip next to its Run button; the other 7 LLM-driven advisor pages (`#/evaluate`, `#/deep`, plus the 5 mode pages — project / training / followup / contacto / interview-prep / patterns) ran a similar 10-60s call but gave no time hint. Adds a `<span class="advisor-eta">⏱ ~30s</span>` (localized via new `advisor.eta` key × 8) next to `UI.providerCostHint(t)` in [evaluate.js](public/js/views/evaluate.js), [deep.js](public/js/views/deep.js), and [mode-page.js](public/js/views/mode-page.js). CSS extends `.auto-eta` to cover `.advisor-eta` with the same styling. The original `auto.eta` chip stays at `~1–2 min` (it's the only multi-step SSE pipeline). 935 → **936** unit. (UX-D-J)

---

## [1.58.41] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux/truthfulness): UX-D-I — cost-hint now re-fetches on tab focus + on `providers-changed` event (M-7 v1.58.12 follow-up).** v1.58.12 wired `UI.providerCostHint(t)` to `/api/status/providers` but only fetched ONCE at node creation. If the user opened `#/config` in another tab, picked a different provider, and switched back, the cost line would silently lie until they navigated away and back. Fix in [public/js/api.js](public/js/api.js#L676-L740): extract a named `refreshCostLine()` function and bind it to `document.visibilitychange` (tab regains focus) + a new `providers-changed` `CustomEvent`. The `#/config` Save handler in [public/js/views/config.js](public/js/views/config.js) dispatches the event after a successful POST, so in-page cost lines (`#/auto`, `#/deep`, `#/evaluate`, mode pages) refresh **without** a page reload or route re-mount. 934 → **935** unit. (UX-D-I)

---

## [1.58.40] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux/docs): UX-D-H — regression-lock: every visible `career-ops.org/docs/...` deep-link must be clickable.** v1.58.36 audit verified live: every existing such URL in `public/js/views/*.js` is already inside `c("a", { href, target: "_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer" }, …)` (apply.js / batch.js / config.js / reports.js), and every `docs/help/*.md` reference uses markdown `[text](url)`. So this release ships only the **regression lock**: new [tests/external-doc-links.test.mjs](tests/external-doc-links.test.mjs) parses every `views/*.js` and `docs/help/*.md` file and fails if a `career-ops.org/docs/<path>` URL is rendered as plain child text (not inside an `<a>` create, attribute slot, or markdown link). Bare brand mentions of `career-ops.org` without `/docs/` path are tolerated (e.g. "career-ops.org schema" in prose). 2 new test cases added to the suite. 932 → **934** unit. (UX-D-H)

---

## [1.58.39] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): NEW-D2 — Dashboard header gets a Refresh button with explicit toast feedback (distinct from connection-banner Refresh of M-9 / v1.58.14).** v1.58.36 audit: there was no in-place refresh on `#/dashboard` — the user had to use the connection-banner Refresh (which does a full `location.reload()` and loses scroll position) just to update the four metric counters. New `↻ Refresh` button in the header in [public/js/views/dashboard.js](public/js/views/dashboard.js) re-fetches `/api/dashboard` and re-renders the view in place via `Router.go("/dashboard")` — no page reload, no scroll loss. Toast pipeline: `Refreshing…` (in-flight) → `Dashboard refreshed` (success) or localized error. Two new i18n keys × 8 locales: `dash.refreshAria` (button aria-label) + `dash.refreshed` (success toast). 931 → **932** unit. (NEW-D2)

---

## [1.58.38] — 2026-05-20

**fix(a11y): NEW-D3 (WCAG 4.1.2) — `#/tracker` search input gets a localized `aria-label` distinct from its placeholder.** v1.58.36 audit: the search input had only `placeholder="Search by company / role…"` and no `aria-label` — screen-reader users heard only the generic role "edit text" with no description of the purpose. Per WCAG 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value) a standalone search input without an associated `<label>` MUST have an explicit accessible name. Fix in [public/js/views/tracker.js](public/js/views/tracker.js): the `filterText` input now declares `type="search"` + `aria-label: t(track.searchAria, …)`. New `track.searchAria` i18n key in all 8 locales — values explicitly different from the placeholder ("Search applications by company name or role title" vs "Search by company / role…") so the SR doesn't hear the same string twice. 930 → **931** unit. (NEW-D3)

---

## [1.58.37] — 2026-05-20

**fix(i18n): NEW-D1 — `#/pipeline` H1 localized on `es` / `pt-BR` / `ru` + 2 stray RU title leaks fixed (`contacto.title`, `health.title`).** v1.58.36 audit caught the H1 of `#/pipeline` rendering the literal `Pipeline` on `es`/`pt-BR`/`ru` while their sidebar items (`Vacantes` / `Vagas` / `Воронка`) were properly localized — promise-fidelity gap with the closed v1.58.18 I18N-011 doctrine (page H1 must match the sidebar term). Updated `pipe.title` in [public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js](public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js): es → `Pipeline de vacantes`, pt-BR → `Pipeline de vagas`, ru → `Воронка вакансий`. New static guard `tests/i18n-no-latin-leaks.test.mjs` (parses the consolidated DICT, asserts no Latin-only `*.title` value on `ru/ja/ko/zh-CN/zh-TW` outside a small whitelist of proper nouns / acronyms / product names). The guard immediately caught two additional stray RU leaks beyond NEW-D1: `contacto.title` (was `LinkedIn outreach` → `Касания через LinkedIn`) and `health.title` (was `Health` → `Состояние`) — both shipped under the same fix. 928 → **930** unit. (NEW-D1)

---

## [1.58.36] — 2026-05-20

**chore(docs): v1.58.36 — full housekeeping sweep at the close of the v1.58.x cycle.** No code or behavior changes — documentation + qa structure + test baselines synced to reality after 32 single-fix releases. **(1) qa/ reorganization:** the three version-locked end-to-end regression snapshots (`REGRESSION-END-TO-END-v1.58.16/33/35.md`) moved into the new `qa/archive/v158-cycle/` directory alongside the pre-cycle MASTER regression and the `FIX-PROMPT-v1.58.3.md` snapshot — `qa/v158-regression/` now contains only the active `FIX-PROMPT-v1.58.4_and_beyond.md` (post-MASTER fix specification, every row marked ✅). **(2) qa/REGRESSION-FINAL.md** gains **§12** documenting every v1.58.x cycle invariant (CSP unconditional, 5 provider rows, `:focus-visible` ring, drawer behavior, help §18, etc.) with its `tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` lock per row. **(3) qa/UX-AUDIT-PROMPT.md** baseline table extended with 30 closed-in v1.58.x rows. **(4) docs/architecture/:** FRONTEND.md gains the notifications-drawer section + v1.58.24 toast-postfix + v1.58.10 modal-drain notes; OVERVIEW.md links to the drawer; TESTING.md totals lifted to **928 unit / 117 files / 62 Playwright / 20 smoke / 23 comprehensive E2E**. **(5) CLAUDE.md** gains a "Hard-won lessons (v1.58.x cycle)" section with 10 captured traps (the `[hidden]` cascade trap, the `npm test | grep` exit-code mask, the `cleanLlmMarkdown ≠ sanitizer` doctrine, etc.). **(6) .github/copilot-instructions.md** baseline lifted to **928 unit / 62 Playwright**. **(7) README ×8 locales:** new "Notifications 🔔" row in every page-table + `tests/` stale count fixed from `284 unit + 12 Playwright + 23 e2e:full` → `928 + 62 + 23 + 20` (baseline @ v1.58.35). Test baseline unchanged: **928** unit · **62** Playwright · **20** smoke · **23** comprehensive E2E. (housekeeping)

## [1.58.35] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ui): v1.58.35 — Notifications drawer no longer auto-opens at page load + new help §18 catalogues all notification categories (user-reported).** Two bugs in one. (1) **Auto-open / never-close:** `.notif-drawer { display: flex }` and `.notif-badge { display: inline-flex }` (v1.58.34) had the same author-level specificity as the UA `[hidden] { display: none }` rule, so the explicit `display` value won and the `hidden` attribute was a no-op — the drawer was visible on every page load and clicking close did nothing. Fix in [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css): explicit `.notif-drawer[hidden] { display: none }` + `.notif-badge[hidden] { display: none }` overrides. The drawer is now ONLY opened by clicking the bell (or Enter/Space when keyboard-focused); a static-guard test asserts there is exactly one `open()` call site in app.js (the bell click ternary), so future edits can't silently introduce another auto-open path. (2) **Undocumented categories:** new **§18 Notifications** section in all 8 help bundles (docs/help/{en,es,ja,ko-KR,pt-BR,ru,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md) — 3 H3 subsections per bundle (Notification categories / What is NOT a notification / Keyboard) catalogue every toast source (Success / Error / Info-progress), what each visual cue means, what's explicitly NOT a notification (Doctor/verify modals, SSE log lines, spinner-only states), and the keyboard contract. Help-section parity baseline lifted 17 → 18; H3 baseline 70 → 73. 927 → **928** unit. (user-reported)

## [1.58.34] — 2026-05-20

**feat(ui): v1.58.34 — Notifications drawer ships on top of the v1.58.33 toast-journal capture (closes U-13 completely).** v1.58.33 shipped the data shape (in-memory `toastHistory` cap 50 + `UI.getToastHistory()`) and explicitly deferred the drawer chrome. This release adds the chrome. **`UI.onToast(fn)`** pub/sub layered on top of the capture in [public/js/api.js](public/js/api.js#L222-L233) — subscribers receive the entry just appended; the implementation guards every subscriber callback in try/catch so a drawer bug can never break the toast pipeline. **Bell button** in the top-bar (`🔔` + red unread badge), `aria-haspopup="dialog"` + `aria-controls="notif-drawer"` + `aria-expanded` flipping on open/close. **Right-slide `<aside role="dialog">`** with localized title (`notif.title`), empty-state (`notif.empty`), and per-entry items showing localized `toLocaleTimeString` + message + (when present) the technical postfix from U-4 (v1.58.24). Newest first; oldest dropped as the U-13 cap bites. Esc + Close button + clicking the bell again all close the drawer; focus restores to the bell (WAI-ARIA APG drawer pattern). 4 new i18n keys (`notif.title`, `notif.empty`, `notif.bellAria`, `notif.closeAria`) × 8 locales. CSS: `.notif-bell`, `.notif-badge`, `.notif-drawer`, `.notif-drawer__head`, `.notif-item` rules. 926 → **927** unit; Playwright 61/61 unchanged. (U-13 follow-up)

---

## [1.58.33] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-13 + U-14 + U-15 — toast journal capture + page-header spacing safety net + CV editor dirty-state indicator (3 closing UX items batched).** Final v1.58.x release. **U-13 (toast journal):** [public/js/api.js](public/js/api.js#L215-L235) — every `UI.toast()` call pushes `{ ts, type, message, detail }` into an in-memory `toastHistory` capped at 50; exposed via the new `UI.getToastHistory()` API. Toasts dwell 3.5-20 s and then vanish; the journal lets future drawer / panel UIs (deferred to a follow-up release) re-surface any missed message. **U-14 (page-header spacing safety net):** new `.page-header h1 + p { margin-block-start: var(--space-2); color: var(--foggy); }` rule in [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css#L604-L612) so any page that uses raw `<h1>+<p>` (without the `.page-subtitle` class) still gets the canonical spacing. **U-15 (CV dirty-state):** [public/js/views/cv.js](public/js/views/cv.js#L208-L240) — Save button gets `.btn-dirty` class + localized `cv.unsaved` tooltip whenever the textarea diverges from the last saved baseline; clicking Save re-baselines and clears the flag. Upload path dispatches a synthetic `input` event so programmatic `ta.value = …` assignments still trigger the dirty toggle. CSS `.btn.btn-dirty` paints a `var(--rausch-dark)` ring + `● ` prefix. 925 → **926** unit. (U-13 + U-14 + U-15)

---

## [1.58.32] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-12 — `#/help` TOC filter input gets a 16ch `min-width` so KO/JA placeholders never clip.** Korean `섹션 필터` and Japanese `セクションをフィルター` are 5-10% wider than the EN `Filter sections`. The input already used `width: 100%` of its `.help-toc` card; we add a `.help-toc__filter` class with `min-width: 16ch` so even if the card narrows, the placeholder still fits in any of the 8 locales. 924 → **925** unit. (U-12)

---

## [1.58.31] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-11 — Tracker `Legitimacy` column header now carries a localized info chip + tooltip explaining the High/Caution/Suspicious scale.** v1.58.3 QA: the badge in each row read `High` / `Caution` / `Suspicious` with no header affordance to learn what they meant. [public/js/views/tracker.js](public/js/views/tracker.js#L228-L246) `<th>` now renders the column label + `<span class="th-info" tabindex="0" role="img">ⓘ</span>` whose `title` + `aria-label` come from a new `track.col.legitimacy.help` i18n key × 8 locales: *"Confidence that the posting is real (High / Caution / Suspicious)."* CSS `.th-info:focus-visible` adds the brand ring so the chip is keyboard-reachable per WCAG 2.4.7. Also repairs the v1.58.30 (U-10) regression where the existing `#25 destructive buttons have a title hint` lock test only checked for `track.fixHint` but the U-10 branch now uses both `track.fixHint` and `track.fixEmpty`. 923 → **924** unit. (U-11 + U-10 follow-up)

---

## [1.58.30] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-10 — Tracker Normalize / Dedup / Merge buttons disabled when `data/applications.md` is empty.** v1.58.3 QA: clicking these buttons on an empty tracker still hit the parent project rewrite endpoints — a no-op the user could not tell was futile. Now [public/js/views/tracker.js](public/js/views/tracker.js#L187-L210) sets `disabled` + `aria-disabled` + a localized tooltip (`track.fixEmpty` × 8 locales) explaining why ("Add a row to the tracker first — this rewrites data/applications.md and there is nothing to rewrite yet."). When rows exist, the buttons re-enable and show the existing `track.fixHint` tooltip. 922 → **923** unit. (U-10)

---

## [1.58.29] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-9 — `#/pipeline` counter ↔ filter row stacks vertically on narrow viewports.** v1.58.3 QA: at ≤ 720 px the `In queue: N` chip and the filter input fought for horizontal space and pushed the input to a cramped column. New `.pipeline-controls` class in [public/js/views/pipeline.js](public/js/views/pipeline.js#L377-L385); CSS rule under `@media (max-width: 720px)` sets `flex-direction: column` + stretches `#pipe-filter` to 100% width. Desktop unchanged. 921 → **922** unit. (U-9)

---

## [1.58.28] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-8 — Generate-prompt block is collapsed by default on the 7 mode pages.** The inline `<pre>` previously ran 1200+ px after the user clicked Generate prompt, pushing Copy + Run-live below the fold. [public/js/views/mode-page.js](public/js/views/mode-page.js#L272-L300) `showPrompt()` now wraps the `<pre>` in `<details class="prompt-block">` collapsed by default; summary shows `Show prompt (N lines)` localized via the new `prompt.show` / `prompt.lines` keys × 8 locales. Copy / Run-live remain immediately visible. Also fixed a pre-existing v1.58.27 regression where the BUG-007/008 contract test rejected the U-7 reformat (intermediate `const stripped` between dismissToast/modal); loosened the adjacency regex from `
s*` to `[sS]{0,1200}?` while still asserting `UI.dismissToast()` runs before `UI.modal(t(…))`. 920 → **921** unit. (U-8)

---

## [1.58.27] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-7 — `verify-pipeline.mjs` ASCII `===` dividers stripped from the result modal.** The script prints `=========`-runs (≥ 50 chars) between sections; in the 14 px monospace modal the run pushed the body wider than the rest of the SPA needs. Strip in [public/js/views/health.js](public/js/views/health.js#L23-L38) via `.replace(/^={10,}$/gm, "")` before rendering; whitespace already separates sections. 919 → **920** unit. (U-7)

---

## [1.58.26] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-6 — `#/scan` "Active companies N/M" chip now explains N vs M via tooltip + aria-label.** v1.58.3 QA: the chip read `▸ Active companies 96/80` with no affordance to learn what 96/80 means. Toggle button in [public/js/views/scan.js](public/js/views/scan.js#L700-L719) now carries `title=` (hover tooltip) and `aria-label=` (screen-reader fallback) sourced from a new `scan.activeCo.help` i18n key in all 8 locales: *"Active: companies currently surfacing results. Total: configured in portals.yml."* 918 → **919** unit. (U-6)

---

## [1.58.25] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux/ia): U-5 — Dashboard CTA dedupe (removed duplicate Open-Pipeline header button + duplicate Scan-all-sources Quick-action tile).** v1.58.3 QA flagged 4× Pipeline / 4× Scan entry-points on Dashboard. v1.55.5 promoted the two P0 hero CTAs (`✨ Auto-pipeline a URL` + `🌐 Scan now`); the header `📋 Open Pipeline` button and the Quick-action `🌐 Scan all sources` tile were then strict duplicates (sidebar already routes to /pipeline; hero already routes to /scan). Removed both in [public/js/views/dashboard.js](public/js/views/dashboard.js). Hero pair + sidebar remain canonical entry-points. 917 → **918** unit. (U-5)

---

## [1.58.24] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-4 — toast error messages now tuck the "(METHOD /path · HTTP NNN)" postfix into a collapsed `<details>`.** v1.57.1 appended a what/where/why postfix to every API error so opaque "validation failed" became "validation failed — … (POST /api/config · HTTP 400)". The technical part is required (BUG-006 invariant — must remain reachable in the DOM), but on the toast headline it competes with the human sentence. `UI.toast()` in [public/js/api.js](public/js/api.js#L215-L266) now parses the trailing postfix with `TOAST_ENDPOINT_RE` and renders it inside a `<details class="toast-detail">` with a localized `<summary>` (`toast.details` key × 8 locales). Headline stays clean; the technical detail is one click away. New `.toast .toast-msg` / `.toast .toast-detail` CSS rules. BUG-006 invariant preserved (postfix still in DOM). 916 → **917** unit. (U-4)

---

## [1.58.23] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-3 — `#/followup` `lastContact` placeholder now adapts to today − 14 days (was the frozen ISO `2026-04-21`).** Static placeholders rot — readers parse them as both a format hint AND a plausible recent example, and the latter drifts into the distant past as time passes. Compute the placeholder at render time in [public/js/views/mode-page.js](public/js/views/mode-page.js#L165-L181): `new Date(); d.setDate(d.getDate() - 14); d.toISOString().slice(0, 10)`. Special-cased only for `cfg.slug === 'followup' && spec.name === 'lastContact'`; every other field still pulls its placeholder from i18n. 915 → **916** unit. (U-3)

---

## [1.58.22] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-2 — `#/auto` H1 no longer wraps to 2 lines because of the leading `✨`.** Pre-fix the `auto.title` i18n value was `✨ Auto-pipeline a URL`; the emoji participated in line-wrap and pushed the title to a second row at 1280-1600 px widths. Split into separate elements in [public/js/views/auto.js](public/js/views/auto.js#L240-L252): `.page-header.page-header--icon` (CSS grid, `auto 1fr` columns) + `<span class="page-icon" aria-hidden="true">✨</span>` + `<h1 class="page-title">{t(auto.title)}</h1>` + `<p class="page-subtitle">`. The emoji now sits on its own column and never participates in line wrap; the H1 wraps freely if needed. `auto.title` i18n value stripped of its leading `✨` in all 8 locales. 914 → **915** unit. (U-2)

---

## [1.58.21] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): U-1 — `#/cv` H1 + subtitle now match every other page (supersedes v1.56.0 UX-9 chip by design).** v1.56.0 UX-9 demoted the page title to a `.cv-breadcrumb` chip (lowercase grey `cv`) so the user's name in the preview "owned" visual space. v1.58.3 QA confirmed it just reads as a layout bug — the page header looks broken next to `#/dashboard`/`#/help`/etc. U-1 promotes [public/js/views/cv.js](public/js/views/cv.js) back to `<h1 class="page-title">` + visible `<p class="page-subtitle">` like every other page; `.cv-breadcrumb` CSS rule removed. **Single-`<h1>` invariant unchanged** (F-V54-A still shifts user `# Name` h1→h2 in the preview, so this stays the page's only H1). Lock test `tests/cv-breadcrumb.test.mjs` (which encoded the now-reversed UX-9 contract) is removed; `tests/cv-single-h1.test.mjs` updated to assert the new `.page-title`-only shape. 913 → **914** unit. (U-1)

---

## [1.58.20] — 2026-05-20

**fix(i18n/platform): I-6 — footer hotkey hint now shows ⌘K on Mac, Ctrl+K elsewhere (localized verb).** Pre-fix the sidebar footer hint was the literal `CTRL+K — search` on every platform and locale. The top-bar `<kbd>` badge already adapted via `data-mac`/`data-other` (v1.56.4 UX-N2); now the footer hint does too. `top.langhint` i18n values embed a `{hotkey}` placeholder (e.g., `{hotkey} — поиск`); new `applyFooterHotkey()` in [public/js/app.js](public/js/app.js#L196-L214) runs on boot + every `I18n.onChange` and replaces `{hotkey}` with `⌘K` or `Ctrl+K` based on `navigator.platform`. The localized verb (`search` / `buscar` / `поиск` / `搜索` / …) stays. 915 → **916** unit (static guard locks the `{hotkey}` shape in all 8 locales, the platform branch, and the `I18n.onChange` re-apply). (I-6)

---

## [1.58.19] — 2026-05-20

**fix(i18n): I-4 — RU `#/followup` H1 + hints no longer leak Latin `cadence` / `follow-up` / `scope` / `timeline`.** v1.58.3 RU regression: H1 `Советник по cadence follow-up`; hint `ISO-дата (YYYY-MM-DD) — основа для cadence.`; notesHint `timeline, internal hold, …`. All replaced with native Russian: `Советник по ритму касаний`, `ISO-дата (ГГГГ-ММ-ДД) — основа для расчёта ритма касаний.`, `сроки, внутренняя пауза, праздники`. companyHint `scope` → `область`. 914 → **915** unit (negative-match guard: no `cadence` / `follow-up` in any RU followup.* string). (I-4)

---

## [1.58.18] — 2026-05-20

**fix(i18n): I-3 — help TOC items 2/5/13/14 free of English bleed in non-Latin locales.** Pre-fix several locale help bundles still showed `## 2. App settings & API keys`, `## 5. Portals & Sources`, `## 13. Mode prompts`, `## 14. Apply checklist` (ru/ja/ko/zh-CN/zh-TW). Now fully localized in all 8 locales (RU `Подсказки режимов` / `Чек-лист отклика`, JA `応募チェックリスト`, KO `앱 설정 및 API 키` / `포털 및 소스` / `지원 체크리스트`, zh-CN `应用设置与 API 密钥` / `模式提示` / `申请清单`, zh-TW `應用設定與 API 金鑰` / `招聘版面與來源` / `模式提示` / `申請清單`). 913 → **914** unit (negative-match guard: items 2/5/13/14 contain none of `App|settings|Apply|checklist|Portals|Sources|Mode|prompts` for the 5 non-Latin locales). (I-3)

---

## [1.58.17] — 2026-05-20

**fix(i18n): I-2 — saved-research dates now use `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` per locale.** The `formatRelative()` helper in [public/js/views/deep.js](public/js/views/deep.js#L57-L82) returned hardcoded English `today` / `1d ago` / `Nd ago` regardless of UI language. Replaced with `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat(I18n.getLang(), { numeric: 'auto' })` — the browser-native localized "today/yesterday/N days ago" string (сегодня/вчера, 今日/昨日, etc.). Dates older than 7 days fall back to `Intl.DateTimeFormat(locale, { dateStyle: 'medium' })`. Defensive try/catch keeps the old English fallback for ancient browsers without Intl. 912 → **913** unit. (I-2)

---

## [1.58.16] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ui): brand-button hover-flicker — pink/red primary & danger buttons no longer flash on hover (user-reported).** Root cause in [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css): the default `.btn-primary` / `.btn-danger` background was a `linear-gradient(135deg, var(--rausch) 0%, var(--rausch-dark) 100%)`; the `:hover` rule replaced it with a solid `var(--rausch-dark)`. CSS cannot interpolate between a gradient and a solid colour, so the 180 ms `transition: background` on `.btn` snapped — the gradient briefly resolved to one of its stops on hover entry/exit, producing the visible white/pink flicker the user reported. Fix: keep the gradient on hover and dim via `filter: brightness(0.92)` instead — `filter` interpolates cleanly in every browser, so the dim/un-dim now animates symmetrically over the existing 180 ms duration. The `.btn` transition list is extended with `filter var(--transition)` so the hover dim actually animates. Mouse pointer-focus state stays clean (uses `:focus`, not `:focus-visible`, per the v1.58.9 M-1 contract). 911 → **912** unit (`tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` asserts the gradient-stays/filter-dims contract on both `.btn-primary:hover` and `.btn-danger:hover`, plus that the pre-fix `background: var(--rausch-dark)` is gone and that `filter` is in the `.btn` transition list). (user-reported)

---

## [1.58.15] — 2026-05-20

**fix(a11y/i18n): I-1 — top-bar search `aria-label` and visually-hidden label now localized.** v1.58.3 verified the global search input shipped `aria-label="Global search — Cmd+K to focus, paste a URL and Enter for auto-pipeline"` regardless of UI language. Screen-reader users on RU/JA/zh-CN/etc. were stuck with English. New generic `data-i18n-aria-label` hook in [public/js/app.js](public/js/app.js#L4-L29) mirrors the existing `data-i18n` / `data-i18n-placeholder` pattern — `applyI18n()` iterates every `[data-i18n-aria-label]` element and calls `el.setAttribute('aria-label', I18n.t(key, …))` on each language change. The top-bar input now declares `data-i18n-aria-label="top.search.aria"`; the visually-hidden `<label>` declares `data-i18n="top.search.label"`. Two new i18n keys (`top.search.aria`, `top.search.label`) added across all 8 locales. The hook is reusable — any future control just adds the attribute. 910 → **911** unit (`tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` asserts the HTML markup wiring, the app.js handler shape, the 8-locale i18n parity, and a sanity check that RU ≠ EN so a copy-paste-English regression can't slip through). (I-1)

---

## [1.58.14] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): M-9 — connection-banner `Refresh` now gives feedback (was silent reload).** v1.58.3 verified the global Refresh button called `location.reload()` synchronously — user sees a brief flash but no explicit signal that anything happened. Fix in [public/js/app.js](public/js/app.js#L131-L161): the click handler now (1) emits a transient `Refreshing…` toast, (2) sets `sessionStorage['refreshedToast']` so the *next* page boot can surface a success toast (the in-flight one is destroyed by navigation), (3) disables the button to swallow rapid double-clicks (no stacking), and (4) defers `location.reload()` by 200 ms so the in-flight toast paints first. On boot, app.js checks the sessionStorage flag, clears it, and emits a success `Refreshed` toast (deferred so it lands after the SPA settles). Two new i18n keys (`common.refreshing`, `common.refreshed`) added across all 8 locales. 909 → **910** unit (`tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` asserts the synchronous progress toast, deferred reload, disabled-guard, sessionStorage handoff, success toast on next boot, and 8-locale i18n parity). (M-9)

---

## [1.58.13] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): M-8 — `#/apply` checklist becomes interactive (delivers the page's promise).** v1.58.3 verified: `▶ Generate checklist` rendered a monospace `<pre>` block listing items 0…7 — read-only text the user couldn't tick. The page is titled "Apply checklist" but didn't actually behave like one. Fix in [public/js/views/apply.js](public/js/views/apply.js#L9-L98) — after the API returns, the raw `r.checklist` text is parsed into items (lines, trimmed, leading `-`/`*`/`1.`/`[ ]` markers stripped) and rendered as a `<ul class="apply-checklist">` of real `<input type="checkbox">` rows. Each row is wrapped in `<label>` so the full row is the click target (WCAG 2.5.5; works with v1.58.9 M-1 focus rings). State is persisted in `localStorage['applyChecklist:' + slug]` (slug = URL stripped of protocol + query, alphanum/`._/:-` only, ≤240 char) — tick three items, reload, three still ticked. Two action buttons: **Copy unchecked** (clipboard the still-open items as `- markdown` bullets) and **Reset** (clear all ticks for this URL). Defensive fallback: if the parser finds zero items, render the raw text as before so the user isn't shown an empty card. New CSS in [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css) (`.apply-checklist`, `.apply-checklist__actions`, line-through on checked spans). Five new i18n keys (`apply.checklist.copyUnchecked`, `resetBtn`, `copied`, `copyFailed`, `reset`) across all 8 locales. 908 → **909** unit (`tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` asserts the checkbox + data-item-index render, the `<label>` wrap, the `applyChecklist:` localStorage prefix, the load/save state functions, the two action buttons, the no-raw-`<pre>` regression-lock, the CSS row sizing, and 8-locale i18n parity for all five new keys). (M-8)

---

## [1.58.12] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): M-7 — cost hint now tracks the active provider (OpenRouter no longer falls through to a fabricated number).** `UI.providerCostHint()` already routed via `/api/status/providers` so the line was provider-aware in spirit, but the per-provider maps in [public/js/api.js](public/js/api.js#L623-L676) only listed `anthropic`/`gemini`/`openai`/`qwen`. With v1.57.0's 5th provider live, OpenRouter fell through to the generic 0.03 fallback **and** rendered the literal `openrouter` (lowercase) as the provider name — both wrong. Per the fix-prompt's intent ("be honest, never quote a fixed number that might be wrong"), the EST map now lists `openrouter: null` (router picks the underlying model — cost varies per request), and the render path branches on `null` to emit a localized `cost varies (router picks)` instead of a fabricated `~$0.03/eval`. NAME map adds `openrouter: 'OpenRouter'` so the user-visible name matches the docs. New i18n key `cost.varies` added across all 8 locales (`cost varies (router picks)` / `coste variable (lo elige el router)` / `coste variable` / etc.). 907 → **908** unit (`tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` asserts `EST openrouter: null`, `NAME openrouter: 'OpenRouter'`, the `=== null` branch + `t('cost.varies', …)` call site, and 8-locale i18n parity). (M-7)

---

## [1.58.11] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): M-4 — saved-research card title↔date gap now structural CSS (was inline margin).** v1.58.3 verified: some saved-research card entries displayed `software-engineer-generaltoday` (no space between title and date), while others were fine — the pre-fix relied on `style="margin-left: 8px"` between two raw `<span>` children, which collapsed on certain entries. The fix in [public/js/views/deep.js:34-55](public/js/views/deep.js#L34-L55) replaces the two anonymous `<span>`s with `.saved-card__title` + a semantic `<time class="saved-card__date" datetime="…">`, wrapped in a `.saved-card` flex container. Spacing is now driven by CSS `gap: var(--space-2, 8px)` so it can't collapse (and you get a11y/SEO `<time>` semantics for free). New CSS in [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css) defines `.saved-card { display: inline-flex; align-items: baseline; gap: var(--space-2, 8px); white-space: nowrap }`, `.saved-card__title { font-weight: 500 }`, `.saved-card__date { color: var(--foggy); font-size: 0.85em; white-space: nowrap }`. 906 → **907** unit (`tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` asserts the new classes, the semantic `<time datetime=…>`, the no-inline-`marginLeft: '8px'` regression-lock, and the CSS gap declaration). (M-4)

---

## [1.58.10] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ux): M-2 — drain the progress toast before any result modal opens.** Clicking `sync-check` on `#/cv` left the "Running cv-sync-check.mjs…" toast bottom-right while the result modal opened — both fighting for attention, and on narrow screens visually overlapping. The Health-page Doctor / verify-pipeline buttons already called `UI.dismissToast()` explicitly before `UI.modal()`; cv.js's sync-check (and any future call site) was the odd one out. Fix in [public/js/api.js](public/js/api.js#L272) — `UI.modal()` now calls `dismissToast()` as its first executable statement so every present and future call site gets the drain for free (defence-in-depth at the boundary). Also localized [public/js/views/cv.js](public/js/views/cv.js#L190-L201) — the previously-hardcoded English `UI.toast('sync-check…')` and `UI.modal('sync-check', …)` now use `t('cv.syncCheckRunning')` and `t('cv.syncCheck')` respectively, satisfying the BUG-008 invariant (modal title == localized button label) for the cv-view path too. Two new i18n keys (`cv.syncCheck`, `cv.syncCheckRunning`) added across all 8 locales. 905 → **906** unit (`tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` static guard for the dismissToast() boundary, the localized cv.js call site, the no-hardcoded-`'sync-check…'`-literal, and 8-locale i18n parity). (M-2)

## [1.58.9] — 2026-05-20

**fix(a11y): M-1 — re-establish a visible `:focus-visible` ring on form fields (WCAG 2.4.7 Level AA).** The v1.58.3 MASTER regression confirmed `getComputedStyle(focusedInput)` returned `outline: rgb(255,255,255) none 1.5px` — i.e. the `none` keyword collapsed the ring to 0 px on every form field. Root cause: the base `.input, .textarea, .select { outline: none }` rule (intentional, to suppress the mouse-focus halo) had higher specificity than the global `*:focus-visible` rule and silently nuked the keyboard-focus ring on 88 focusable elements per page. Same issue on `.searchbar input { outline: none }` for the global ⌘K/Ctrl K search. Fix in [public/css/app.css](public/css/app.css) — add explicit `.input:focus-visible, .textarea:focus-visible, .select:focus-visible` and `.searchbar input:focus-visible` rules with `outline: 2px solid var(--rausch)` + a translucent box-shadow so keyboard-only focus paints a visible ring while mouse focus stays clean (uses `:focus`, not `:focus-visible`). 904 → **905** unit (`tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` static CSS contract guard for all three new rules + the regression-lock for the pre-existing global `*:focus-visible`); Playwright **60 → 61** (`tests/playwright-smoke.mjs` Tab-traversal test asserts the computed outline on a `#/config` form field is ≥1.5 px wide and not `none`). (M-1)

## [1.58.8] — 2026-05-20

**feat(health): surface `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `QWEN_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` on `#/health` (analogous to `GEMINI_API_KEY`).** v1.57.0 added OpenRouter as the 5th headless live-eval provider; v1.55.3 (UX-2) added on-screen onboarding for the 4-provider mix. The `#/health` page however only reported `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — the other three providers' key state was invisible there even though `/api/status/providers` already routed evals to them. User request: extend the same "set / unset (manual mode)" row pattern to every headless provider. [server/lib/routes/health.mjs](server/lib/routes/health.mjs#L57-L71) now pushes three additional optional check rows (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `QWEN_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) wired to the same `isUsableKey` gate as `/api/status/providers` (`hasOpenAIKey()`, `hasQwenKey()`, `hasOpenRouterKey()` were already imported but unused). "manual mode" wording is identical to the GEMINI row across the SPA's 8 locales — the Health view iterates over `body.checks` so no per-locale string change was needed. 903 → **904** unit (`tests/api.test.mjs` extended to assert all three new optional rows; `ok=true` still holds since they're not required). (NEW user-requested feature)

---

## [1.58.7] — 2026-05-20

**fix(security): NEW-2 — `isValidJobUrl` now rejects paired template-placeholder syntaxes (`${…}`, `{{…}}`) to match the error message.** The route-level 400 returned by `POST /api/pipeline` advertises *"contain no script or template characters"*, but the v1.58.3 MASTER regression confirmed only ASP/EJS-style `<%…%>` was actually blocked (free side effect of the `[<>"'`\\\s]` bracket-char gate). JS template literals (`${TEST}`) and Mustache/Handlebars (`{{TEST}}`) both passed validation — a regex↔message semantic gap. Option A from the fix-prompt (tighten regex to match message; slight hardening against URL-templating injection): a new `TEMPLATE_PATTERNS` array in [server/lib/security.mjs](server/lib/security.mjs) (`/\$\{[^}]*\}/`, `/\{\{[^}]*\}\}/`) is consulted via `hasTemplatePlaceholder(url)` before `new URL(…)`. Only **paired** placeholders are rejected — a bare `{normal}` ATS-style path token survives (`https://boards.greenhouse.io/anthropic/jobs/4567` and `https://example.com/job/{normal}` both still accepted). 901 → **903** unit (`tests/url-validation.test.mjs` extended with 2 NEW-2 tests covering both rejected forms and the no-false-positive ATS case). The `<%…%>` regression-lock is also explicit now. (NEW-2)

---

## [1.58.6] — 2026-05-20

**fix(a11y/i18n): BUG-008-tb — top-bar `Doctor` modal title now matches the localized button label.** The ledger row BUG-008 fixed in v1.58.0 ("modal title == localized button label") closed the **Health page** entry-point. The v1.58.3 MASTER regression then found the **top-bar** entry-point still violated the invariant: regardless of UI locale, clicking the top-bar `Doctor` button opened a modal titled `doctor` (hardcoded English, lowercase). Repro: EN top-bar `Doctor` → modal title `doctor`; RU top-bar `Диагностика` → modal title `doctor`. Two entry paths, one invariant, one passing. Fix in [public/js/app.js:118](public/js/app.js#L118) — replace the literal `'doctor'` with `I18n.t('top.doctor', 'Doctor')`. The `top.doctor` i18n key (already present in all 8 locales: EN `Doctor` · ES/pt-BR `Diagnóstico` · KO `진단` · JA `診断` · RU `Диагностика` · zh-CN `诊断` · zh-TW `診斷`) is the same key the button declares via `data-i18n="top.doctor"`, so the modal title is now textually identical to the visible button label across all locales. Static contract guard added in `tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` (BUG-008-tb): asserts the `I18n.t('top.doctor', 'Doctor')` form in `app.js`, the no-hardcoded-`UI.modal('doctor',`-literal, the 8-locale presence of `top.doctor` in `i18n-dict.js`, and the button↔key wiring in `index.html`. 900 → **901** unit; Playwright 60/60. (BUG-008-tb)

---

## [1.58.5] — 2026-05-20

**fix(ui): NEW-3 — `#/followup` Run-live double-POST triaged *not-reproducible*; locked with Playwright regression guard.** The v1.58.3 MASTER regression observed (via monkey-patched `window.fetch`) two identical POSTs to `/api/mode/followup` within ~2 s after a single click on `#/followup` Run live (company/role/notes filled, date intentionally empty). Per the fix-prompt's "repro first" doctrine, source inspection of `public/js/views/mode-page.js::submit()` shows: (a) the Run-live and Generate-prompt buttons are plain `<button>` elements with a single `onClick` each — there is no parent `<form>` and no `addEventListener('submit')` to double-fire, and (b) `UI.withSpinner()` (FIX-L1) sets `button.disabled = true` for the duration of the in-flight request, so a second physical click during the request is blocked at the source. A new Playwright test in `tests/playwright-smoke.mjs` (`NEW-3 — single click on #/followup submits exactly one POST`) walks the **exact** regression recipe — fills company/role/notes, leaves the date blank, clicks the manual-prompt button (which shares the `submit()` function with Run live), and asserts **exactly one** `POST /api/mode/followup` over a 3 s window. Locale-stable selector (the `▶` glyph is the same in all 8 locales), and `addInitScript` seeds `career-ops-ui:lang=en` so a prior language test in the same browser context can't perturb the field selectors. Playwright **59 → 60**. Original QA observation is filed as recipe-only; no shipped code change required. (NEW-3)

---

## [1.58.4] — 2026-05-19

**fix(security): NEW-1 — emit `Content-Security-Policy` on every response (was loopback-gated).** Before v1.58.4 the CSP header was layered on only when `isPubliclyExposed()` was true (HOST bound beyond loopback); over `127.0.0.1` both `/` and `/api/health` returned **no** CSP, leaving `UI.md()`'s escape-first contract as the only XSS defence. The v1.58.3 MASTER regression (§5) flagged this as a stop-ship invariant gap. CSP is now **unconditional** and identical on every response regardless of bind address: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; form-action 'self'`. `script-src` never allows `'unsafe-inline'`/`'unsafe-eval'`. The directive set is unchanged from the prior exposed-only policy (already SPA-correct — Google Fonts allowlisted for Inter), so no visual or functional regression. `tests/security-headers.test.mjs` was rewritten to lock CSP-present-on-loopback; a Playwright route-walk (en/ru/ja/zh-TW × 7 routes) asserts **0 CSP violations**. 900 unit · Playwright 58→59 · e2e 20/20+23/23. Next fix-prompt items (NEW-3, BUG-008-tb, NEW-2, M-1…) ship as subsequent one-fix releases per project doctrine. See `qa/v158-regression/FIX-PROMPT-v1.58.4_and_beyond.md`. (NEW-1)

---

## [1.58.3] — 2026-05-19

**fix(deep): R-2 / FIX-C1 — strip ORPHAN / unbalanced agent-scaffolding tags from research output.** v1.58.0 added `cleanLlmMarkdown` but it only removed *paired* `<tool_call>…</tool_call>` blocks and a *dangling open* tag. A deep regression of v1.58.2 found a model that emitted a **lopsided trace** — an orphan closing `</tool_response>` (and `</thinking>`) with no opener — which survived and rendered literally in the saved `#/deep` brief. A final conservative sweep now removes **any** standalone scaffold token (open or close, balanced or not): `tool_call|tool_response|tool_use|function_call|function_results|thinking`, the Anthropic tool XML (`<invoke …>`/`</invoke>`/`<parameter …>`/`<function_calls>` and `antml:`-namespaced forms), and fenced ```tool_* blocks. Pure + idempotent; real `<https://…>` autolinks and `` `<code>` `` spans are preserved (only the named agent tokens match). **FIX-C2** (`<html lang>` not updating) was triaged **not-reproducible** — `i18n.js` already sets `document.documentElement.lang` on `setLang` AND at boot and detects `navigator.language`; the QA repro was a stale `localStorage`/pre-redeploy artifact. Locked both with regression guards. 896 → **900** unit · Playwright 58/58 · e2e 20/20+23/23. The remaining v1.58.3 fix-prompt items (M-1 focus-ring, M-4..M-9, I-1..I-6, U-1..U-15) are queued as subsequent one-fix ships per project doctrine (never batched). See `qa/v158-regression/`.

## [1.58.2] — 2026-05-19

**fix(i18n): I18N-011 — localize the `#/help` table-of-contents in all 7 non-EN locales.** The `#/help` "On this page" TOC is built from the `##` section headings of `docs/help/<lang>.md`. Sections 3/4/6/7/8/9/10/11/12 (Profile, CV, Health, Scan, Pipeline, Evaluate, Reports, Tracker, Deep research) still carried their **English** titles in es/pt-BR/ko/ja/ru/zh-CN/zh-TW, so the TOC showed English while the sidebar nav was translated. Each affected heading is now localized to the **exact same term as the sidebar `nav.*` key** (single source of truth — TOC ↔ sidebar match), preserving the section number and the `(#/route …)` parenthetical verbatim. EN unchanged (canonical). 7–9 headings per locale. Closes the sole open i18n backlog item from the v1.58 QA sweep. Docs-only; 896/896 unit · 33/33 help tests · Playwright 58/58. See `qa/v158-regression/`.

---

## [1.58.1] — 2026-05-19

**fix(test): CI-isolated `checkProfileCustomized` guard (patch over v1.58.0).** v1.58.0 shipped green on the advisory pre-commit but red on `ci.yml` (Node 18/20/22): the new BUG-002/UX-032 test used a cache-bust dynamic import + `PATHS` rewrite, but `server/lib/paths.mjs` resolves the project root **once per process**, so the temp root never took effect under the shared `npm test` runner (it coincidentally passed locally). Replaced with a robust **static guard** that asserts the `store.mjs` allow-list contains the fixture names AND that the regex is `^(…)$/i` exact-anchored (so a real name merely containing "test" — e.g. `María Testanova` — is provably never false-flagged). No production code changed; this also unblocks `publish-package.yml` (it runs the suite before publishing). 896/896 unit · Playwright 58/58. See `qa/v158-regression/`.

---

## [1.58.0] — 2026-05-19

**fix(qa): external QA-report bug sweep + clean, formatted research output.**

### 🐛 Fixes (QA report)

- **BUG-001 (Critical)** — `#/followup` now validates the optional *Last contact* field client-side as an ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`); junk no longer reaches the LLM (and burns a credit). Generic `pattern` support added to the mode-page form factory.
- **BUG-003 (Major, every help page)** — `**bold**`, `` `code` ``, *italic* and `[links]` now render **inside block-quotes** in `UI.md()` (the `> **Audience:**` cards showed literal `**`). Safe-by-construction (content is already HTML-escaped before `inline()` runs).
- **BUG-005 (Major)** — adding a URL already in the pipeline now shows an honest *“Already in the queue — skipped”* info toast instead of a misleading green “Added”.
- **BUG-006 (Major)** — the invalid-URL message is humanized/sentence-cased (“That doesn't look like a valid job posting URL — …”). The `(POST /api/pipeline · HTTP 400)` where/why context stays by design.
- **BUG-007/008 (Major/Minor)** — the “Running doctor.mjs…” progress toast is dismissed before the result modal opens (new `UI.dismissToast()`), and the modal title reuses the localized button label so its casing always matches.
- **BUG-010** — the `#/reports` empty state now has the descriptive page-subtitle every other page has.
- **BUG-002 / UX-032 (code-side)** — `checkProfileCustomized()` now flags QA/test-fixture names (`Acceptance Test`, `Real Person`, `QA`, …) as *not customized*, so the Health card and prompts stop treating a test profile as the real candidate. The parent project's `config/profile.yml` / `cv.md` are **not** touched (hard rule #1) — the data cleanup is the user's; this is the heuristic fix.
- **I18N-012/013** — Russian `deep.title`, `deep.subtitle` (“smart questions”), and `dash.quick.deepCta` are now actually translated.

### ✨ Features / UX

- **Clean, formatted research output.** New `server/lib/llm-output.mjs::cleanLlmMarkdown()` strips agent/tool scaffolding the model sometimes echoes (`<tool_call>{…}</tool_call>`, `<tool_response>`, `<tool_use>`, `<function_call>`, `<thinking>`, `[TOOL_CALL]…`) from `#/deep` and **Saved research**. Applied at every chokepoint — Anthropic / OpenAI / Qwen / OpenRouter clients, the Gemini subprocess path, **and** on serving an already-saved brief (older files render clean too). The SPA already renders these via the XSS-safe `UI.md()`, so the result is a properly formatted document.
- **`#/outreach` alias** → `#/contacto` (BUG-004) for a consistent, bookmarkable English URL; canonical slug stays `contacto` (parent mode filename).
- **AI-review rule 3** — the client-owned network-error sentence is localized via `I18n.t()` (`api.netError` / `api.netHint`, 8 locales). Documented decision: server-emitted validation `details` are intentionally English diagnostics (consistent with every other server error; the SPA surfaces them verbatim and localizes its own chrome).

### 🧪 Tests

- New `tests/qa-report-fixes.test.mjs` (10) and `tests/llm-output.test.mjs` (5, incl. idempotency + “don't eat real code blocks”). `checkProfileCustomized` exercised directly (real name containing “test” is **not** false-flagged). Updated `url-validation` + `config-validation-detail` assertions for the new messages; `e2e-comprehensive` now date-aware. 881 → 896 unit; Playwright 58/58; e2e 20/20 + 23/23.

### Triaged, not changed (with rationale)

- **BUG-009** (`#/cv` H1 is a quiet breadcrumb chip) — *by design*: the single-`<h1>` WCAG 1.3.1 decision (F-V54-A); changing it risks an a11y regression.
- **BUG-002 data, UX-022** (parent `profile.yml`/`cv.md`/`portals.yml` content) — *parent-owned*; hard rule #1 forbids the repo editing parent files. Code-side detection hardened instead.
- Long-tail minor i18n/UX (I18N-011 help-TOC localization, I18N-014..019, UX-020/021/023/024/025/026/027/028/029/030/031) — tracked backlog; deferred to avoid a large unreviewed change set in a patch line.

## [1.57.2] — 2026-05-19

**fix(config): the ACTUAL root cause of `/#/config` "validation failed" — the SPA-injected `lang` field.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Saving anything on `/#/config` from the browser always returned `validation failed`.** `public/js/api.js` auto-attaches a `lang` field to *every* JSON POST body (so LLM routes pick up the UI locale). `/api/config` is not an LLM route and `lang` is not a config key, so `validateConfig`'s (correct, security-relevant) unknown-key rejection 400'd **every Save** with `validation failed — lang: not a known config key`. This was browser-only: curl/in-process repros never sent `lang`, which is why v1.57.0/.1 (whitespace-trim, descriptive errors) improved the *message* but didn't fix the *cause*. The config route now strips the transport-only `lang` before validating; the `KNOWN_KEYS` write-filter still drops any genuinely-unknown key, so the attacker-injection guard is unchanged.
- Found by a new Playwright form sweep that drives the real save button — not the synthetic fetch repros that masked it.

### 🧪 Tests

- New **`tests/playwright-forms.mjs`** (26, wired into `npm run test:e2e:browser`): drives a real Chromium over **every form-bearing route** — asserts no console errors site-wide, the invalid-save toast shows field+reason+request-context, secret fields never echo the typed value, valid saves succeed, and PORT/HOST show their prefilled defaults.
- `tests/config-endpoint.test.mjs`: browser-parity cases — POST with `lang` succeeds (and `lang` never lands in `.env`), while a real unknown key with `lang` present is still rejected. 879 → 881 unit; Playwright 32 → 58.

## [1.57.1] — 2026-05-19

**fix(ux): every API error now says WHAT failed, WHERE, and WHY — and the input-error text is maximally descriptive.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **"validation failed" was opaque.** The server already returned `{ error, details: ["FIELD: reason", …] }`, but every form's `catch (e) { UI.toast(e.message) }` showed only the top line, so on `/#/config` (and everywhere) the user couldn't tell *which* field was wrong. `api.js` now folds the per-field `details` into the thrown message **site-wide** (one change, every form benefits), appends the request context `(METHOD /path · HTTP NNN)` so the toast says *where* it failed, falls back to a trimmed raw-body snippet for non-JSON errors, and includes the verb+path on network errors. `err.details` is also exposed for inline rendering.
- **Input-error messages are now maximally descriptive.** `validateConfig` explains what's wrong and how to fix it — e.g. `PORT: must be 1-65535 — a whole number, digits only (the default is 4317); you entered "abc"`; `HOST: invalid hostname/ip — only letters, digits and . : - _ are allowed (e.g. 127.0.0.1 …)`; the Anthropic message now points to console.anthropic.com and tells you to use the right provider's field. **Secret keys never echo the entered value** (only its character length), so a mistyped real key can't leak into a toast or log.
- **PORT range is now actually enforced** — a 5-digit value above 65535 (e.g. `99999`) was previously accepted; it's now rejected with a clear reason.

### ✨ UX

- **`/#/config` PORT and HOST are pre-filled with their real defaults** (`4317` / `127.0.0.1`) instead of looking empty/unconfigured.
- **Error toasts stay on screen long enough to read** — dwell time scales with message length (9–20 s for errors; success/info keep the snappy 3.5 s) and the toast wraps + scrolls instead of clipping a detailed message to one line.

### 🧪 Tests

- New `tests/config-validation-detail.test.mjs` (12): api.js detail-folding + WHERE/WHY context + toast dwell (static guards); config.js PORT/HOST defaults; server contract that every error is a field-prefixed string; descriptive-message assertions; **secret-no-echo leak guard**; the 1–65535 range fix. 874 → 879.

## [1.57.0] — 2026-05-19

**feat(provider): OpenRouter as a 5th headless live-eval provider + fix(config): "validation failed" when saving any API key.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`/#/config` no longer rejects valid API keys with "validation failed".** Pasted keys routinely arrive with a trailing newline or surrounding spaces (OS clipboard, the "copy" buttons on provider consoles). Pre-1.57 that tripped the newline guard for **every** provider, and the `$`-anchored `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` charset regex (`/^sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}$/`) false-rejected genuine Anthropic keys whose base64url tail / future prefix didn't fit the class. `validateConfig` now normalizes (trims) every value **before** validating, the route persists the trimmed value (so it authenticates at runtime — no stray-newline `.env` quoting), and the Anthropic check is a resilient `sk-ant-` prefix + length sanity check (the shared `isUsableKey()` 20-char floor remains the real "is it real?" gate). Internal newlines are still rejected — that `.env`-injection guard is intact.

### ✨ Features

- **OpenRouter is now a first-class provider.** Add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` on `/#/config` and one key fronts 300+ models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Qwen, DeepSeek …). It's the **last** entry of the `auto` order (Anthropic → Gemini → OpenAI → Qwen → **OpenRouter**), so an existing setup is never silently re-routed; `LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter` pins it. Wired into the same `_tailProvider()` path as OpenAI/Qwen across `/api/evaluate`, `/api/deep`, `/api/mode/:slug`, and surfaced by `/api/status/providers` + the Health dashboard. OpenAI-compatible client (zero new deps — direct `fetch`, `AbortController` timeout, key never logged) with the recommended `HTTP-Referer`/`X-Title` attribution headers.
- **The OpenRouter model dropdown is live.** `OPENROUTER_MODEL` is a dynamic select fed by **`GET /api/openrouter/models`** — a server-side proxy of OpenRouter's public catalogue (keeps the CSP `connect-src 'self'` envelope intact; no browser→third-party fetch). It degrades to a curated namespaced fallback list when the catalogue is unreachable (offline / rate-limited / 5xx), so the dropdown is never empty, and a 10-minute in-memory cache keeps repeat `/#/config` visits from re-hitting OpenRouter. New i18n keys (`config.openrouter*`) across all 8 locales; `config.llmProviderHint` updated.

### 🧪 Tests

- New CI-isolated suites: **`tests/openrouter-route.test.mjs`** (proxy answers 200 with a non-empty namespaced list even offline; leaks no secret) and **`tests/openrouter-model-selector.test.mjs`** (env-config contract + config.js wiring + 8-locale i18n parity). Extended `env-config`, `openai`, and `provider-selector` suites: trim/relax validation, `runOpenRouter`/`hasOpenRouterKey`/`fetchOpenRouterModels`, the appended `auto` tail, and the OpenRouter gate. Two previously-weak `validateConfig` cases (used the no-longer-known `HH_USER_AGENT`, so they passed for the wrong reason) now assert against a real key. 831 → 855.

## [1.56.4] — 2026-05-19

**feat(ui): UX-N2 — visible, platform-aware ⌘K / Ctrl K hint on the global search input.**

### ✨ Features

- **The Cmd/Ctrl+K "focus search" shortcut is now discoverable on screen.** It lived only in the input's `aria-label` / source, so sighted users never found it and the app felt slower than it is. A muted `<kbd class="kbd-shortcut">` now sits at the end of the search pill, filled at boot from `data-mac` / `data-other` by a platform check (`navigator.platform`/`userAgent`): **⌘K** on macOS/iOS, **Ctrl K** elsewhere. It is `aria-hidden="true"` (the existing `aria-label` already announces the shortcut to screen readers — the badge must not double-announce) and `pointer-events:none` (decorative). The existing Cmd/Ctrl+K keybinding is unchanged. No new i18n keys (the glyphs are universal); the badge is a flex child of the existing `.searchbar` (no wrapper / absolute positioning — the input is already `flex:1`).

### 🧪 Tests

- New CI-isolated source-static suite **`tests/cmdk-hint-visible.test.mjs`** (5): the `.kbd-shortcut` `<kbd>` lives inside the `.searchbar` pill; it is `aria-hidden="true"` with both `data-mac`/`data-other` variants; `app.js` fills it via a `navigator` platform check from the dataset; the existing `(e.ctrlKey||e.metaKey)&&e.key==='k'` → `search.focus()` keybinding is intact (regression guard); `app.css` styles `.kbd-shortcut` and never `display:none`. index.html/app.js/app.css are browser-only → asserted statically. 826 → 831.

## [1.56.3] — 2026-05-19

**fix(reliability): provider key detection rejects placeholder / too-short values, not only the empty string.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **A placeholder `GEMINI_API_KEY` in a parent `.env` was reported "✓ set" AND mis-selected as the active provider over a valid `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.** `effectiveEnv()` only rejected `undefined`/`''`, so a 10-char placeholder counted as a real key: the onboarding banner showed *GEMINI ✓ set*, `GET /api/status/providers` returned `activeProvider: "gemini"`, and every live ⚡ eval would have silently failed against a dead key while a working 108-char Anthropic key was ignored. New pure `isUsableKey()` (`env-config.mjs`) treats a secret as configured only when it is ≥ 20 chars (no supported provider's key is shorter — Gemini `AIza…` ≈ 39, Anthropic `sk-ant-…` ≈ 100+, OpenAI ≥ 40, Qwen ≈ 35 — so a real key is never false-negatived) and not a known placeholder (`your_*_here`, `changeme`, `placeholder`, `<…>`, all-one-char, …). Applied uniformly to `hasAnthropicKey()`/`hasGeminiKey()` (`anthropic.mjs`), `hasOpenAIKey()`/`hasQwenKey()` (`openai.mjs`), and the `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` rows of `GET /api/health` — which also moved off raw `process.env` onto the same effective+plausible view, so the health page, the providers endpoint, and the OR-router now always agree. `selectActiveProvider()` is unchanged; it just receives a correct `keysConfigured`.

### 🧪 Tests

- New CI-isolated suite **`tests/key-detection-rejects-placeholder.test.mjs`** (5): `isUsableKey` unit cases (empty/non-string, too-short incl. the 10-char repro, long-but-placeholder, realistic keys accepted) + an in-process `createApp()` reproduction of the exact reported scenario (10-char `GEMINI_API_KEY` + real `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in a temp parent `.env`, the 4 keys stripped from `process.env`) asserting `gemini` is NOT in `keysConfigured`, `activeProvider === "anthropic"`, and the `/api/health` rows agree. Four existing `anthropic`/`openai` effective-env layering tests had trivially-short stub keys (`sk-x`, `AIzaTEST`, `sk-o`, …) lengthened to realistic values — the layering contract they assert is unchanged; only the stubs had to clear the new floor. 821 → 826.

## [1.56.2] — 2026-05-19

**feat(a11y): UX-N1 — per-route, locale-aware `document.title` (multi-tab orientation + screen-reader page-change announcement).**

### ✨ Features

- **Every SPA route now sets a distinct, localized `document.title`.** Pre-fix all 24 routes kept the static `index.html` `<title>` ("career-ops — command center"), so multi-tab browsers showed identical tab labels, bookmarks were generic, and the screen-reader "page changed" announcement read the same on every navigation. `public/js/router.js` `focusNewView()` now derives the title from the view's own localized `<h1 class="page-title">` — `"<View> — career-ops"` — so titles are automatically translated (no new i18n keys) and distinct per route. Set **before** the first-paint guard so the initial tab is titled too (the same ordering rule the v1.56.0 UX-12 `tabindex` set follows). Falls back to `career-ops — command center` when a view has no heading.

### 🧪 Tests

- New CI-isolated source-static suite **`tests/document-title-per-route.test.mjs`** (4): `focusNewView` assigns `document.title`; the title is derived from the view `<h1>` textContent (per-route + localized, not one hardcoded literal); the assignment precedes the `!firstPaintDone` early-return; a sane product default is present. router.js is browser-only → asserted statically (same approach as `dashboard-initial-focus.test.mjs`). 817 → 821.

---

## [1.56.1] — 2026-05-19

**fix(a11y): suppress the spurious brand focus ring on router-managed `tabindex="-1"` heading focus.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **A red box framed every view's `<h1>` (regression surfaced by v1.56.0 UX-12, rooted in the v1.41.0 SPA focus-management pattern).** `public/js/router.js` gives each destination view's heading `tabindex="-1"` and `.focus()`'s it on every client-side navigation so screen readers announce the new page. A `tabindex="-1"` element is never keyboard-reachable, yet Chromium's `:focus-visible` modality heuristic still painted the global brand ring (`*:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--rausch) }`) around it — a **red rectangle around the page heading** (e.g. "Command Center" on `#/dashboard`) on every navigation, which had also been baked into the `images/dashboard-*.png` hero screenshots. The fix is one scoped rule — `[tabindex="-1"]:focus, [tabindex="-1"]:focus-visible { outline: none }` — the WAI-ARIA APG managed-focus pattern. Genuine keyboard focus on real interactive controls keeps the global `*:focus-visible` ring (WCAG 2.4.7 intact); the skip-link's ring is unaffected (it is an `<a>`, not `tabindex="-1"`, with a higher-specificity rule).
- All 8 `images/dashboard-*.png` regenerated against the fixed UI — the README hero screenshots no longer show the red box.

### 🧪 Tests

- New CI-isolated source-static suite **`tests/managed-focus-no-ring.test.mjs`** (4): the global `*:focus-visible` brand ring is still defined (WCAG 2.4.7 not regressed); `[tabindex="-1"]:focus, :focus-visible` resolves to `outline: none`; the suppression rule follows the global rule (cascade safety); the fix stays scoped (no blanket `*:focus { outline: none }`). Pairs with the existing `tests/dashboard-initial-focus.test.mjs` (router still sets tabindex + focuses on navigation). 813 → 817.

## [1.56.0] — 2026-05-19

**feat(ux): LOW-priority polish bundle — UX-9 / UX-10 / UX-11 / UX-12 (one grouped minor release).**

### ✨ Features

- **UX-9 — `#/cv` breadcrumb (visual hierarchy):** the page title is demoted to a quiet uppercase `.cv-breadcrumb` chip and the loud page-subtitle paragraph moves to the `<h1>` `title` tooltip, so the user's CV (their name, rendered in the preview) owns the visual space. The F-V54-A invariant is intact — still **exactly one `<h1>`**, still `.page-title` (the router focus target); only its weight changed.
- **UX-10 — honest cost ballpark (trust/feedback):** a new shared `UI.providerCostHint(t)` helper renders next to ⚡ Run live on `#/auto`, `#/evaluate`, `#/deep` and every `#/<mode>`. It reuses `GET /api/status/providers` (v1.55.3): with a key it shows *"Estimated cost: OpenAI gpt-5-codex · ~$0.04/eval"* (order-of-magnitude, deliberately "~"); with no key it states plainly that ⚡ Run live copies a manual prompt at no API cost. Fail-soft (hidden when offline).
- **UX-11 — `#/help` TOC auto-jump (aesthetic/flow):** when the TOC filter narrows to **exactly one** section, the page smooth-scrolls there after a 300ms idle (debounced — mid-typing keystrokes never yank the page; never fires for 0 or >1 matches), reusing the same scroll+focus path as a TOC click.
- **UX-12 — `#/dashboard` first-paint a11y (accessibility):** on the very first SPA paint the landing view's `<h1>` is now made programmatically focusable (`tabindex="-1"`) so screen-reader / heading navigation lands on it, and `#content` stays `aria-live="polite"` so the heading is announced on boot — **without** stealing focus (that would fight the skip-link, the deliberate v1.41.0 behaviour). Only subsequent route changes move focus. *(Note: UX-12 as originally specified — "call focusNewView() on boot" — conflicted with the v1.41.0 skip-link decision; resolved conservatively to satisfy the a11y intent without the regression.)*
- New i18n keys `cost.estimate`, `cost.manual` ×8 locales; new token-based `.cv-breadcrumb` / `.cost-hint` CSS.

### 🧪 Tests

- 4 new CI-isolated source-static suites — **`tests/cv-breadcrumb.test.mjs`** (3), **`tests/run-cost-line.test.mjs`** (4), **`tests/help-toc-autoscroll.test.mjs`** (4), **`tests/dashboard-initial-focus.test.mjs`** (3): single-h1 + breadcrumb class; shared helper exported + fail-soft + present in all 4 views + `cost.*` ×8; debounced exactly-1-match jump gated; tabindex-before-guard ordering + focus-after-guard + `#content` aria-live. The pre-existing `cv-single-h1` and `help-nav-a11y` locks were updated for the new (invariant-preserving) code. 800 → 813. Live Playwright probe of all four (no-key fixture): single h1 13px breadcrumb, cost hint manual note, TOC→1 narrow, h1 tabindex=-1 + aria-live polite, 0 console errors.

## [1.55.8] — 2026-05-19

**feat(tracker): server-side pagination + clickable funnel chips (UX-8).**

### ✨ Features

- **Server:** `GET /api/tracker` gains **optional** `?page` / `?pageSize` / `?status` query params. With none, the response is byte-for-byte the legacy `{ rows: [...] }` (every existing caller/test untouched). With them, it returns `{ rows: slice, total, page, pageSize, funnel }` — `pageSize` clamped to `[1,500]`, `page` clamped to `≥1`, `status` filters `rows`+`total`, and `funnel` is the **whole-history** status→count breakdown (independent of the page or status filter, so the UI chips are always accurate).
- **`#/tracker`:** a new clickable **funnel summary chip bar** at the top — *"all statuses · N · Applied · N · Interview · N · Offer · N · Rejected · N …"* (ordered Applied → Responded → Interview → Offer → Rejected → Discarded → Evaluated → SKIP). Clicking a chip sets the Status filter (clicking the active chip clears it); the active chip is `aria-pressed` and visually highlighted. The pipeline state is now legible at a glance instead of buried behind a dropdown. Feedback/forms lens.
- New i18n key `track.funnelAria` ×8 locales; new token-based `.tracker-funnel` / `.tracker-chip` / `.tracker-chip--active` CSS.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/tracker-server-paged.test.mjs`** (new, 7 cases, CI-isolated, in-process Express on an ephemeral port + temp `CAREER_OPS_ROOT` applications.md fixture — CLAUDE.md #2/#8): back-compat (no params ⇒ exactly `{rows}`, no envelope leak); `?page&pageSize` slice + `total`+`page`+`pageSize`+full `funnel` summing to N; last partial page with no overlap; out-of-range page ⇒ empty rows + valid total; `?status=` filters total/rows while funnel stays whole-history; `pageSize` cap; plus a source-static lock on the `.tracker-funnel` chip bar (toggle-on-reclick, `aria-pressed`, `track.funnelAria` ×8, CSS). 793 → 800.

---

## [1.55.7] — 2026-05-19

**feat(pipeline): vanilla-JS row virtualization at >1000 rows (UX-7).**

### ✨ Features

- `#/pipeline` rendered **every** row (`filtered.forEach(list.appendChild(urlRow))`) — a real scan fills the queue with thousands of URLs, so thousands of row nodes (each a flex div + `<a>` + two buttons) were built synchronously on every filter keystroke, flooding the DOM and the accessibility tree. New **vanilla-JS virtualization** (a react-window equivalent, no deps): above `VIRTUALIZE_THRESHOLD = 1000`, `#/pipeline` becomes a fixed-height (`70vh`) scroll viewport with a non-shrinkable spacer (`flex:0 0 auto`, `height = rows × 56px`) that preserves the **real scrollbar for the full list**, and an rAF-throttled scroll listener renders only the viewport ± a 5-row buffer (~16–19 nodes at a time instead of N). At/below the threshold the original simple full render is kept **byte-for-byte**, so typical pipelines and all existing pipeline tests/e2e are unaffected. Each virtualized row keeps its URL-disambiguated ▶/✕ `aria-label` (F-V54-B regression-locked). Window math is a pure `computeWindow()` helper.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/pipeline-virtualize.test.mjs`** (new, 5 cases, CI-isolated, source-static): a numeric ~1000 threshold gates the path; the ≤threshold branch keeps the simple `forEach`→`appendChild`; the >threshold branch renders `slice(start,end)` with a rAF-throttled scroll listener + a scrollbar-preserving spacer; `computeWindow()` clamps `[0,total]` with a ± buffer; rows keep the disambiguated ▶/✕ aria-labels. 788 → 793. Live Playwright probe (1200-URL fixture): `scrollHeight≈67248` (full range), only ~16–19 row nodes in the DOM, window tracks scroll end-to-end (row 0 → 595 → 1199), 0 console errors.

---

## [1.55.6] — 2026-05-19

**feat(scan): tuck secondary filters behind an "Advanced filters" disclosure (UX-4).**

### ✨ Features

- `#/scan` stacked every filter — free-text, remote/hybrid/onsite, scope, source, and the post-scan stack/level/dynamic facet chips — at equal weight, a wall of controls. Now the **everyday filters stay visible** (free-text + Remote/Hybrid/Onsite; the 🌐 Scan button is already separate in the controls card) and the **secondary ones collapse behind a `<details class="scan-advanced"><summary>Advanced filters</summary>`**: the Scope + Source selects, and — separately — the stack/level/dynamic facet-chip cluster (which now leads the fresh result set with the table, not a wall of chips, and only renders when at least one chip row exists). Cognitive-load lens.
- New i18n key `scan.advancedFilters` across all 8 locales; new token-based `.scan-advanced` summary styling (quiet ⚙ affordance, marker-less, bold when open).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/scan-advanced-disclosure.test.mjs`** (new, 6 cases, CI-isolated, source-static): an Advanced-filters `<details>`/`<summary>` exists with the `.scan-advanced` hook and `scan.advancedFilters` label; free-text + remote stay in the always-visible group; scope + source live inside the disclosure; `chipsContainer` is a `<details>`; `.scan-advanced summary` is styled; `scan.advancedFilters` ×8 locales. 782 → 788.

## [1.55.5] — 2026-05-19

**feat(dashboard): hero-promote the 2 P0 CTAs + a focal recent-activity hint (UX-3).**

### ✨ Features

- `#/dashboard` opened with ~30 equal-weight nodes — no clear "what next". A new `.dash-hero` block now sits directly under the page header: the two P0 journeys — **✨ Auto-pipeline a URL** and **🌐 Scan now** — are promoted to large `.btn-hero` buttons, and a single **focal recent-activity hint** ("Last evaluation: `<score>` — `<title>`", linked to the report; a guiding empty-state on cold start via `dash.heroNoEval`) tells a returning user where they left off and a new user the one action that matters. The two primary buttons were removed from the header (only the secondary "📋 Open pipeline" stays there) so the action isn't duplicated.
- The application-status buckets were demoted from prominent `.badge`s to quiet `.dash-chip` pills so they no longer compete with the hero (Information-scent / cognitive-load lens).
- New i18n keys `dash.lastEval`, `dash.heroNoEval` across all 8 locales; new token-based `.dash-hero` / `.btn-hero` / `.dash-chip` CSS.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/dashboard-hero.test.mjs`** (new, 5 cases, CI-isolated, source-static): a `.dash-hero` block exists and precedes the Quick-actions grid; both P0 CTAs are `.btn-hero` with the `/auto` + `/scan` routes; a focal `dash.lastEval` hint + `dash.heroNoEval` empty-state; status buckets use `.dash-chip`; `.dash-hero`/`.btn-hero`/`.dash-chip` CSS exists; `dash.lastEval` + `dash.heroNoEval` ×8 locales. 777 → 782.

---

## [1.55.4] — 2026-05-19

**feat(ux): honest auto-pipeline ETA next to Run + prominent Stop during a scan (UX-6).**

### ✨ Features

- `#/auto`: a new `.auto-eta` hint — *"⏱ ~1–2 min"* (key `auto.eta`, `title` via `auto.etaTitle`) — now sits directly next to the Run button, so the one-click promise is honest about duration *before* the user commits. The wording matches career-ops.org/docs ("paste a URL → full report in 1–2 minutes"). Feedback & system-status lens.
- `#/scan`: while the multi-minute crawl is running (`aria-busy`), the **Stop** control is promoted from a low-contrast ghost button to a prominent destructive button (new `.btn-danger` — filled, high-contrast white-on-coral, weight 600). `setScanRunning(running)` flips `scan-stop-btn` between `btn-danger` (running) and `btn-ghost` (idle, when it is hidden anyway), so the user can find and trust Stop under load. Error-recovery lens.
- New i18n keys `auto.eta`, `auto.etaTitle` across all 8 locales; new token-based `.btn-danger` / `.auto-eta` CSS.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/auto-eta-stop.test.mjs`** (new, 4 cases, CI-isolated, source-static): `#/auto` renders `t('auto.eta')` with the `.auto-eta` class adjacent to `runBtn`; `auto.eta` ×8 locales; `setScanRunning(running)` promotes Stop to `btn-danger`; `.btn-danger` exists with high-contrast white text. 773 → 777.

---

## [1.55.3] — 2026-05-19

**feat(onboarding): on-screen 4-provider OR status — cold-start banner + active-provider chip (UX-2, HIGH).**

### ✨ Features

- New read-only endpoint **`GET /api/status/providers`** → `{ activeProvider, activeModel, keysConfigured }`. `keysConfigured` uses the same effective-env view as the `llm.mjs` gate sites (process.env ∨ parent `.env`, via `hasAnthropicKey/hasGeminiKey/hasOpenAIKey/hasQwenKey`); `activeProvider` is what the OR-router would actually pick — `selectActiveProvider()`, a new pure helper in `env-config.mjs` that walks `providerOrder()` (so an `LLM_PROVIDER` pin with no matching key correctly yields `null`). No secrets are returned — only provider names + the model id.
- The SPA shell now renders a global onboarding region (`#onboarding-banner`, populated by `app.js` from that endpoint, CSP-safe DOM only): **0 keys → a red banner** "No LLM key set — '⚡ Run live' is in manual-prompt mode…" with a CTA deep-linking to `#/config?tab=api-keys`; **≥1 key → a subtle chip** naming the active provider + model (e.g. *Live eval: OpenAI (gpt-5-codex)*). It re-evaluates on locale change and when the user navigates away from the config tab (keys may have just been saved). This makes the product's headline differentiator — "one of Anthropic / Gemini / OpenAI / Qwen works, auto-ordered" — discoverable on screen instead of learned by trial.
- New i18n keys `onboarding.noKey.title`, `onboarding.noKey.cta`, `onboarding.activeProvider` across all 8 locales; new `.onboarding-warn` / `.onboarding-ok` CSS (token-based, mirrors `.conn-banner`).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/onboarding-key-banner.test.mjs`** (new, 9 cases, CI-isolated): `selectActiveProvider` auto-order / none / `LLM_PROVIDER`-pin semantics; `GET /api/status/providers` in-process (ephemeral port + temp `CAREER_OPS_ROOT` `.env` so the real parent key is never read — CLAUDE.md #2/#8) for 0-key, 1-key+model, and Anthropic-over-Gemini auto order; static SPA wiring (banner host, endpoint fetch, `#/config?tab=api-keys` CTA) + `onboarding.*` ×8 locale coverage. 764 → 773.

---

## [1.55.2] — 2026-05-18

**fix(cv): give the `#/cv` markdown editor a descriptive, self-contained accessible name (F-V55-H / UX-5).**

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- The `#/cv` primary editor `<textarea id="cv-editor">` now carries a descriptive `aria-label` via the new `cv.editorAria` key — *"CV markdown editor — your professional resume in markdown format"* — instead of the terse name it inherited from the visible "Markdown" section heading. Note: contrary to the F-V55-H symptom (which only inspected `aria-label`/`labels`), the field was **not** nameless — v1.47.0 (WS2 #16) had already bound it via `aria-labelledby` → the `<h3 id="cv-md-heading">Markdown</h3>`, so a screen reader announced "Markdown, edit, multiline". v1.55.2 upgrades that terse "Markdown" to a self-contained label so a screen-reader user lands and immediately knows what the field is. The redundant `aria-labelledby` is removed (a leftover would be dead markup — `aria-label` wins per ARIA precedence); the visible `<h3>Markdown</h3>` stays on screen for sighted users. WCAG 1.3.1 + 4.1.2; parallels the v1.54.5 batch-tsv fix (F-V54-C).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/cv-editor-a11y.test.mjs`** (new, 3 cases, CI-isolated, source-static like `auto-stepper-prerender.test.mjs`): `#cv-editor` names itself via `t('cv.editorAria', …)` with a non-empty fallback; `cv.editorAria` is present and non-empty in all 8 locales; no redundant `aria-labelledby` remains on the element. 761 → 764.

## [1.55.1] — 2026-05-18

**fix(auto): pre-render the 5-stage pipeline stepper on `#/auto` mount (F-V55-E / UX-1, senior obs S-4 reopened).**

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- `#/auto` now shows the documented five-stage outline — **validate → fetch → evaluate → save report → add tracker** — the moment the screen mounts, instead of staying blank until the first SSE event. Previously `<ol class="auto-stepper">` was created `display:none` and `renderStepper()` was only reached from `setStep()` / `run()`, so a cold-start user never saw the pipeline the docs promise before clicking Run. The stepper is now visible on mount with all five steps in the `pending` state, and carries an `aria-label` (`auto.stepperAria`) so assistive tech announces the region. Closes F-V55-E (a11y/static-guarantee lens) and UX-1 (promise-fidelity lens) — same fix, both lenses.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/auto-stepper-prerender.test.mjs`** (new, 4 cases, CI-isolated, source-static like `router.test.mjs`): the `STEPS` array is exactly the 5 canonical stages in order; `stepperEl` is not `display:none` on mount and carries `auto.stepperAria`; a mount-scope `renderStepper()` call precedes `function setStep(`; `auto.stepperAria` is present in all 8 locales. 757 → 761.

## [1.55.0] — 2026-05-18

**feat(llm): headless live-eval runs via "OR" — Anthropic | Gemini | OpenAI | Qwen, auto-selected by whichever key is set.**

### ✨ Features

- Per user request, the web-ui ⚡ live eval now works with **whichever API key is set**, not just Anthropic/Gemini. `LLM_PROVIDER` gains `openai` and `qwen`; `auto` (default) uses the first provider whose key is present, preferring **Anthropic → Gemini → OpenAI → Qwen**. An explicit value pins one; a forced provider with no key still falls through to the manual-prompt path.
- New `server/lib/openai.mjs` — a zero-dependency OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions client (same secure direct-HTTPS pattern as `anthropic.mjs`: `AbortController` timeout, key never logged, `effectiveEnv()` key resolution so a parent-`.env` key works without a restart). One core (`runOpenAICompatible`) backs **`runOpenAI`** (api.openai.com) and **`runQwen`** (Alibaba DashScope OpenAI-compatible mode; override the endpoint with `QWEN_BASE_URL` in the raw `.env` for the mainland-CN host). No SDKs, **no arbitrary CLI execution** — the parent project stays CLI-agnostic (Claude Code · Codex · Gemini · OpenCode · Qwen · Copilot · Kimi); this only extends the *headless* API-key path.
- The OpenAI/Qwen tail is wired into all eval surfaces: `/api/evaluate`, `/api/deep`, `/api/mode/:slug`, and the `/api/auto-pipeline` SSE — consulted after the existing Anthropic (inline) + Gemini (subprocess) branches so the auto preference is preserved, with the same bundled-context inlining Anthropic uses.
- `env-config.mjs`: `QWEN_API_KEY` (secret) + `QWEN_MODEL` (not secret) added to `KNOWN_KEYS`/`KEY_GROUPS.core`; `LLM_PROVIDERS` and `providerOrder()` extended; `OPENAI_API_KEY` is now a first-class headless provider key (was stored-only).
- `#/config` API-keys tab: `LLM_PROVIDER` select gains `openai`/`qwen`; new `QWEN_API_KEY` + `QWEN_MODEL` fields (curated `qwen-max`/`qwen-plus`/`qwen-turbo`/`qwen2.5-*` list); a new top-of-tab note explains the CLI-agnostic parent vs the headless web-ui eval and the OR order. Updated OpenAI/provider hint copy. New i18n keys (`config.providerModelNote`, `config.qwen*`) + 3 updated hints, across all 8 locales.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/openai.test.mjs`** (new, 9 cases, CI-isolated): OpenAI/Qwen success + block-array content, Bearer auth, default + `QWEN_BASE_URL`-overridden endpoints, 4xx/5xx/malformed, `max_tokens` clamp, timeout, `effectiveEnv` key detection, no-key-leak canary. **`tests/provider-selector.test.mjs`** updated for the v1.55.0 `providerOrder`/`LLM_PROVIDERS`/SECRET surface + the OpenAI/Qwen tail wiring. 748 → 757.

## [1.54.10] — 2026-05-18

**fix(auto-pipeline): SSE client-disconnect hygiene — kill the flaky Playwright e2e job.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- The Playwright e2e job intermittently went red (32/32 individual tests pass, but `not ok 2 - tests/playwright-smoke.mjs`): closing a page while the `#/auto` SSE stream was mid-flight made the server's next `res.write()` reject with `EPIPE`/`"aborted"`, and — with no `'error'` listener on the response — Node escalated it to an uncaughtException that node:test reported as "asynchronous activity after the test ended". `openSse()` in `auto-pipeline.mjs` now registers a no-op `res.on('error')` and guards `send()` on `res.writableEnded || res.destroyed` (wrapped in try/catch) — a vanished client is expected, not exceptional. This is correct production SSE hygiene, not just a test fix.
- `tests/playwright-smoke.mjs`: the Cmd+K test used a real outbound URL (`https://example.com/jobs/123`) but only waited for the modal to appear, so `closePage()` aborted the server's in-flight `safeGet()` after the test ended. It now waits for the pipeline to reach a terminal state (so the fetch resolves normally before close). A shared `closePage()` helper (`window.stop()` then close) and the `after`-hook `server.closeAllConnections()` remain as defence-in-depth. Verified: 8/8 consecutive green runs (6× `node --test` + 2× browser-smoke), previously ~1-in-2 red.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/auto-pipeline.test.mjs`** +1 static case locking the `openSse` disconnect-hygiene contract (`res.on('error')` listener + `writableEnded||destroyed` guard + try-wrapped writes). 747 → 748.

## [1.54.9] — 2026-05-18

**fix(llm): honour the parent `.env` LLM keys at request time — stop mis-routing to a stale/invalid provider.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- Live evaluation could fail with *"Gemini API error: API key not valid"* even when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` was the configured provider. Root cause: `hasAnthropicKey()` / `hasGeminiKey()` (and `runAnthropic`'s key/model lookup) read **only the boot-time `process.env` snapshot**. If the Anthropic key was added to the parent `.env` after the server started, the running process never saw it → Anthropic detection was false, and evaluation fell through to whatever stale key *was* in `process.env` (often an old, invalid `GEMINI_API_KEY`). The Gemini exec path (a parent Node subprocess) already read the live parent `.env`, so the two providers resolved keys inconsistently.
- New `effectiveEnv(key, envFilePath)` in `env-config.mjs`: a non-empty `process.env` value wins (covers shell exports and the live-apply in `POST /api/config`); otherwise the **current parent `.env` file** is consulted. `anthropic.mjs` now resolves `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, and the Gemini-key check through it, so a key set in the parent `.env` is honoured **without a server restart** and key DETECTION always matches the key the request actually SENDS. Provider order is unchanged (`auto` → Anthropic-then-Gemini); this only fixes detection. Keys are never logged or returned (the REVIEW-B4 no-leak test still passes).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/anthropic.test.mjs`** rewritten to be CI-isolated (temp `CAREER_OPS_ROOT`, dynamic import) with 2 new cases reproducing the exact bug (key only in parent `.env` → detected; `runAnthropic` sends the parent-`.env` key + model when `process.env` is unset). **`test: tests/env-config.test.mjs`** +3 `effectiveEnv` cases (process.env precedence, `.env` fallback incl. empty-string-as-unset, missing-file / absent-key / no-path → undefined) — 100% of the new branch. 742 → 747.

---

## [1.54.8] — 2026-05-18

**feat(config): Modes field-form always renders the canonical schema (even on an empty/stub file) with career-ops.org field guidance.**

### ✨ Features

- The v1.54.3 Modes field-form only rendered fields for `##` sections that already existed — so on a fresh, empty, or non-schema `modes/_profile.md` (e.g. the common 1-line stub) it fell back to *"No ## sections found — use the raw editor below."* and the user never got fields. Per user request (*"разбей по полям … описание полей возьми из career-ops.org/docs"*), the form now **always renders the 5 canonical fields in documented order** (Target Roles, Adaptive Framing, Exit Narrative, Comp Targets, Location Policy), pre-filled from the file when present and empty-but-editable when not — so a brand-new profile can be filled in entirely through the form.
- Each field shows a **description sourced from the canonical career-ops.org Quick Start §Step-5** (what to put in Target Roles / Adaptive Framing / Exit Narrative / Comp Targets / Location Policy), wired via `aria-describedby` for screen readers.
- Heading-variant tolerant: the template's `## Your Target Roles` (etc.) maps to the same canonical field as `## Target Roles`, so neither the template nor the server-scaffold convention breaks the form.
- `collect()` is now a tagged payload: a non-destructive **`{ sections }` merge** when the rendered headings exactly match the file's existing ones (preamble + untouched + custom sections survive byte-stable), or a **`{ markdown }` full-file rebuild** that bootstraps/normalises a schema-conformant document when the file lacked the schema. The rebuild path is **confirm-gated** in `config.js` (it replaces the parent file — WS2 #4 destructive-save invariant), preserves the existing preamble (or a documented default), and keeps non-canonical sections verbatim.
- 6 new i18n keys (`config.modesDescTargetRoles` … `config.modesDescLocationPolicy` + `config.modesFormRebuildBody`) across all 8 locales.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/modes-form.test.mjs`** — rewritten for the v1.54.8 contract: schema + canonical order, config.js payload/confirm wiring, every field's doc-sourced description present in all 8 locales, `canonicalKey` "Your X" tolerance, list round-trip stability, the bootstrap-always-renders guarantee, and the tagged sections-vs-markdown collect() with data-safety. Verified live against the real parent stub file (5 fields + descriptions appear, 0 console errors) and an isolated stub fixture (fill → confirm-gated save → all 5 canonical sections persisted). 742 unchanged (7 cases, replaced).

## [1.54.7] — 2026-05-18

**fix: W-001 — code/style assets + SPA shell served `Cache-Control: no-store` (deploy-hygiene).**

### 🐛 Fixes

- The SPA loads `api.js` / `router.js` / every view via plain `<script src>` with no version query string, and there is no build step (no content hashing), so after a deploy a browser could keep serving a **cached old bundle for hours** → stale-cache 404s on query-string routes (observed live during the v1.29.2 regression; regression run W-001). `server/index.mjs` now sets `Cache-Control: no-store` on `.js` / `.mjs` / `.css` / `.html` via the `express.static` `setHeaders` hook, and explicitly on the SPA-shell catch-all (which uses `sendFile` and bypasses `setHeaders`), so the browser always revalidates the code that drives routing. Non-code static assets keep `express.static`'s default caching. Security headers (CSP / nosniff / frame-deny / referrer-policy) are unchanged — verified by the existing `security-headers` suite (8 cases) running green alongside the new test.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/asset-cache-control.test.mjs`** — 4 cases (JS assets `no-store`, CSS `no-store`, static `index.html` `no-store`, SPA catch-all deep-route shell `no-store`), booting the real app against an isolated `CAREER_OPS_ROOT`. Plus a flaky-teardown fix in `tests/playwright-smoke.mjs` (separate `test(e2e)` commit): the auto-pipeline SSE smoke test now cancels the reader + aborts the fetch in a `finally` and the `after` hook force-closes lingering sockets, eliminating the post-teardown "Error: aborted" that reddened the v1.54.6 Playwright e2e job. 738 → 742.

## [1.54.6] — 2026-05-18

**fix(a11y): S-7 — `#/help` back-to-top button carries the canonical `back-to-top` selector class.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- The `#/help` floating back-to-top button worked correctly (verified live) but its class list (`btn btn-primary help-back-top`) sat outside the `.back-to-top` selector convention the spec §2 #28 test targets — a tightened selector would have flaked (regression run S-7, "easy win"). The button now also carries the canonical `back-to-top` class. Purely additive and a CSS-no-op: `help-back-top` (the existing CSS hook) is unchanged and `back-to-top` has no CSS rule — it's a stable test/automation handle only. Verified live: `document.querySelector('.back-to-top')` resolves the button, `aria-label` intact, 0 console errors.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/help-nav-a11y.test.mjs`** — extended the existing #12 case with an assertion that the back-to-top button's class list includes the canonical `back-to-top` selector (no new file; 738 unchanged).

---

## [1.54.5] — 2026-05-18

**fix(a11y): F-V54-C — `#/batch` TSV editor has an accessible name.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- The `#/batch` TSV textarea had a hint wired via `aria-describedby` but **no accessible name** — no `<label htmlFor>`, no `aria-label`/`aria-labelledby` (regression run F-V54-C; WCAG 1.3.1 Info & Relationships / 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value). `aria-describedby` supplies a *description*, not a *name*, so a screen reader announced an unlabelled "edit text". The textarea now carries an `aria-label` via the new i18n key `batch.tsvAria`, consistent with the sibling run-control inputs that already use `*Aria` keys; the existing describedby hint is preserved. Verified live: `aria-label` present + localized, `aria-describedby` intact, 0 console errors.
- New i18n key `batch.tsvAria` across all 8 locales.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/batch-tsv-accessible-name.test.mjs`** — 2 cases (the `batch-tsv` block has an `aria-label` via `t(batch.tsvAria)` while keeping its describedby hint; `batch.tsvAria` defined in all 8 locales). 736 → 738.

---

## [1.54.4] — 2026-05-18

**fix(a11y): F-V54-B — `#/pipeline` row-action buttons have accessible names.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- The per-row `▶` (evaluate) and `✕` (delete) buttons on `#/pipeline` were icon-only with only a `title` attribute (regression run F-V54-B; WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value). `title` is not a reliable accessible name, so a screen-reader user heard a long run of indistinct "button"s and could not tell which row a delete would hit. Both buttons now carry an explicit `aria-label` disambiguated by a compact URL via a new `shortUrl()` helper (`host` + `…/` + last 2 path segments; trailing-slice fallback for unparseable input), so the a11y tree reads e.g. *"Delete: hh.ru/…/vacancy/12345"*. No new i18n keys — reuses `common.delete` / `pipe.evaluateBtn` + the URL. Verified live: 1385 rows, each button name unique per row, 0 console errors.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/pipeline-row-action-names.test.mjs`** — 4 cases (both buttons wired with `shortUrl(url)` + exactly two such labels, `shortUrl` declared before use, same-host different-job URLs don't collapse, bare-host / unparseable / empty fallbacks). 732 → 736.

## [1.54.3] — 2026-05-18

**feat(config): structured field-form for the `#/config` "Modes" tab (no more raw markdown).**

### ✨ Features

- The "Modes" tab edited `modes/_profile.md` as one raw `<textarea>` per `##` section (v1.36.0 section-level granularity). Per user request — *"собери данные по полям, разбей из документации, определи набор полей и реализуй поля именно, а не сырой"* — it now renders a **structured field-form derived from the documented schema** (career-ops.org Quick Start §Step-5):
  - `Target Roles` / `Adaptive Framing` / `Comp Targets` → **repeatable add/remove labelled line-inputs** (one role/angle/comp line per field, `＋ Add line` / per-row `✕` with `aria-label`).
  - `Exit Narrative` / `Location Policy` → **single labelled prose `<textarea>`**.
  - Each field is a real `<label htmlFor>`-bound control with an i18n section name.
- New `public/js/lib/modes-form.js` (`window.ModesForm`) owns the parse → render → `collect()` logic; it feeds the **existing** `PUT /api/modes/_profile { sections }` merge path, so the preamble, ordering, and any section the form doesn't touch survive byte-stable (merge-not-replace, server-enforced).
- **Data-safety:** a canonical list section whose body isn't a pure bullet list (user put prose there) and any non-canonical `##` section fall back to a labelled verbatim `<textarea>` with an explanatory note — arbitrary content round-trips untouched, never silently reshaped or lost. Round-trip stability proven: `serialise(parse(body))` re-parses identically.
- The raw full-file markdown editor remains as the confirm-gated **Advanced** disclosure for add/remove-section and preamble edits (WS2 #4 destructive-save gate unchanged).
- 10 new i18n keys (`config.modesTargetRoles` … `config.modesUnknownNote`) across all 8 locales.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/modes-form.test.mjs`** — 7 cases (documented schema present, config.js wires `ModesForm.build/collect` + drops the stale `modesSectionInputs` map, list classification incl. scaffold/prose/mixed, list & prose round-trip stability, empty-list → empty section, custom-section verbatim data-safety). 725 → 732. Verified live against an isolated `CAREER_OPS_ROOT` fixture: 5 canonical sections rendered as fields + 1 custom section as a labelled fallback, edit-and-save round-trip preserved the preamble + custom section, 0 console errors.

---

## [1.54.2] — 2026-05-18

**feat(config): OpenAI / Codex model selector in `#/config`.**

### ✨ Features

- `#/config` had no way to pick the OpenAI / Codex model — only `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and `GEMINI_MODEL` had dropdowns, even though `OPENAI_API_KEY` was already exposed for the parent multi-CLI (Codex / OpenCode) flow. `OPENAI_MODEL` is now a first-class env key: added to `env-config.mjs` `KNOWN_KEYS` (ordered right after `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and the `core` key group, and **deliberately not** in `SECRET_KEYS` — it's a model id, not a credential, so it's never masked. `config.js` gains a curated `OPENAI_MODELS` list (`gpt-5-codex` default, then `gpt-5` / `gpt-5-mini` / `gpt-4.1` / `o4-mini` / `o3`) and an `OPENAI_MODEL` `<select>` field rendered immediately after the OpenAI key, mirroring the Anthropic/Gemini model fields exactly (same `kind: 'select'`, `aria-describedby` hint wiring, label = env-var name). Read by the parent Codex / OpenCode CLI flow — web-ui live-eval still uses Anthropic|Gemini. Verified live: `#/config` → `OPENAI_MODEL` select with 6 options, default `gpt-5-codex`, label-bound, 0 console errors.
- New i18n keys `config.openaiModel` + `config.openaiModelHint` across all 8 locales.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/openai-model-selector.test.mjs`** — 4 cases (env-config core/non-secret contract + key ordering, `OPENAI_MODELS` list with `gpt-5-codex` default, the `OPENAI_MODEL` select field wired after `OPENAI_API_KEY`, both i18n keys across all 8 locales). 721 → 725.

## [1.54.1] — 2026-05-18

**fix(a11y): F-V54-A — `#/cv` single `<h1>`.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- The CV markdown's own `# Name` rendered as a **second** top-level `<h1>` next to the page-title `<h1>CV</h1>` (regression run F-V54-A; WCAG 1.3.1 Info & Relationships / 2.4.6 Headings). `cv.js` now feeds every preview-injection point (initial render, file-import refresh, live editor sync) through a scoped `cvMd()` that shifts headings down one level (h1→h2 … h5→h6, h6→`role="heading" aria-level="7"`), so the page keeps exactly one `<h1>`. Scoped to `cv.js` on purpose — `UI.md` is shared by help/reports/deep/evaluate, which manage headings their own way (help strips article h1s + builds its TOC from h2). Verified live: `#/cv` → 1 page `<h1>` ("CV"), the user's `# Name` is now `<h2>`, 0 console errors.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/cv-single-h1.test.mjs`** — 4 cases (cvMd shift chain, every preview site uses cvMd not raw UI.md, single page-title h1, the transform re-derived + proven to map every level down). 717 → 721.

### Verification

```bash
$ npm run test:ci
# 721 / 721 · ✓ no .also( leftovers · ✓ CHANGELOG parity: all 8 locales at v1.54.1

## [1.54.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS10 — canonical-docs re-validation + help-bundle H3 parity (final convergence release).**

The absolute-last workstream: re-validate the SPA against the 5
canonical `career-ops.org/docs` guides + the parent project, close the
last structural doc-divergence, and refresh the SDD spec — shipped as
its own release per the WS10 mandate.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(docs): help-bundle H3 parity — en=70 vs locales=68`** — the CHANGELOG/structure CI gate only checked **H2**, so `docs/help/en.md` had silently drifted to 70 `### ` subsections while all 7 localized bundles stayed at 68. The gap was §17 ("How to add a new job-portal source"): the **"Reference adapters"** table + **"Common pitfalls"** list had been added to en only. Both are now translated into es/ja/ko-KR/pt-BR/ru/zh-CN/zh-TW (adapter filenames, relative links, `registry.mjs`, `r.source === fs`, `fetchImpl`/`signal`, `tracked_companies` kept byte-identical). All 8 bundles: **17 H2 / 70 H3**.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(help): H3-parity gate`** — `help-ru-config-section.test.mjs` now also asserts every bundle (en + 7) has an identical H3 count (70), not just H2. An en-only `###` addition can no longer silently diverge the localized bundles. 716 → 717.

### 📝 Documentation

- **Canonical re-validation:** `tests/canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs` (7/7) confirms the help bundles still mirror all 5 canonical guides — *what-is-career-ops*, *scan-job-portals*, *apply-for-a-job*, *batch-evaluate-offers*, *set-up-playwright* — and the WS2 UX-audit (40 findings, every screen Playwright-verified across v1.41→v1.52) validated every screen against documented behaviour. No divergence found.
- **`docs/sdd/CONVENTIONS.md`** refreshed to v1.54.0 reality: test totals (716 `node --test` + 4 E2E + shell-surface tier), the new H3-parity gate, updated file-size outliers (scan/config grew with WS2), and a new **Accessibility** section codifying the WS2 patterns (focus-trapped `UI.confirm`, WAI-ARIA tabs, SSE live-regions, label binding, sortable-table `aria-sort`, async-relabel announce) as standing conventions.

### Verification

```bash
$ npm run test:ci
# 717 / 717 · ✓ no .also( leftovers · ✓ CHANGELOG parity: all 8 locales at v1.54.0
# help bundles: all 8 → 17 H2 / 70 H3 · canonical-docs-coverage 7/7
```

> WS0–WS10 complete. Only WS11 (qa/ actualization + final QA prompt) remains.

## [1.53.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS9 — shell-surface test pyramid (the last untested layer).**

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/sh-files.test.mjs`** — the 4 `bin/*.sh` scripts and the `.githooks/pre-commit` hook had **zero** coverage. 10 cases now lock: `bash -n`/`sh -n` syntax, shebang + executable bit, and the behavioural contracts other workstreams depend on:
  - `career-ops-ui.sh` — `help` exits 0 + prints usage with **no shell-source leak** (v1.40.0 regression guard), unknown verb exits 2 with usage on stderr, `usage()` is a heredoc (not the fragile `sed`-scrape), all dispatcher case-labels present.
  - `start.sh` — `NO_OPEN` honored, Node ≥ 18 gate, browser-raise delegated to `scripts/open-dashboard.mjs` (v1.43.0 guard), no bare `open "$URL"`.
  - `setup.sh` — strict mode, `SKIP_START`, clones both repos, `need git`.
  - `run_all.sh` — `--quick`/`--no-e2e` parsing, runs all 4 suites via `run_suite`.
  - `.githooks/pre-commit` — execs the WS7 reviewer; **no shell file invokes `git --no-verify`** (CLAUDE.md hard rule #7 guard); `install-hooks.mjs` wires `core.hooksPath` and is the npm `prepare` step.
- 706 → 716.

### 📝 Documentation

- `docs/architecture/TESTING.md` — added the **shell-surface base layer** to the pyramid diagram + a v1.53.0 totals note (716 `node --test` cases / 90 files + 4 E2E surfaces); documents that `scripts/*.mjs` logic is covered by `cli-doctor`/`open-dashboard`/`ai-precommit-review`/`provider-selector` + the CI-gate scripts.

## [1.52.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 LOWs #33–#40 — batched polish sweep (closes the UX-audit queue).**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y/i18n): WS2 LOW batch`** — eight low-severity findings:
  - **#33** `#/dashboard` — the 3 header CTAs were inconsistent (only 2 had a leading icon); "Open Pipeline" now gets `📋` so all three match.
  - **#34** `#/profile` — archetype `fit`/`level` rendered as two bare ambiguous chips; now prefixed (`Fit: …` / `Level: …`) with matching `aria-label`.
  - **#35** `#/health` — Run-doctor / verify toasts showed raw `doctor.mjs` / `verify-pipeline.mjs` strings; now i18n-keyed (`health.runningDoctor/Verify`).
  - **#36** `#/health` — the check results were a flat run of `<div>`s with no programmatic name↔status link. Now a `role="list"` `<ul>`/`<li>` and the status badge carries `aria-label="<check>: <status>"`.
  - **#37** `#/reports` — report cards were mouse-only `<div onClick>`; now `role="link"` + `tabindex="0"` + Enter/Space handler + `aria-label`.
  - **#38** `#/activity` — the paginator comment said "200" while the code requested 500; reconciled to a `CAP` constant and a `role="note"` notice now surfaces when the 500-cap truncates older history (`activity.truncated`).
  - **#39** `#/batch` — prose placeholders were hardcoded English while their `aria-label`s were localized; the four (`minScore/maxRetries/model/startFrom`) are now i18n-keyed (the TSV-template placeholder stays — it's a data-format example).
  - **#40** mode pages — the async health probe relabelled/reordered the primary button silently; a visually-hidden `role="status"` region now announces it (`mode.liveReadyAnnounce`).

### 🌐 i18n

- 10 new keys × 8 locales (`set.fit/level`, `health.runningDoctor/Verify`, `activity.truncated` (`{n}` preserved), `batch.minScorePh/maxRetriesPh/modelPh/startFromPh`, `mode.liveReadyAnnounce`). `i18n-coverage` gate green.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/low-sweep.test.mjs`** — 9 cases (one per finding + the 10-key ×8 i18n check). 697 → 706. Playwright-verified: health `ul[role=list]` (17 `li`, badge aria "Node version: OK"), report card role=link/tabindex/aria, dashboard CTAs all-iconed, 0 console errors.

> This closes the WS2 UX-audit queue (#1–#40 across v1.41→v1.52). Next: WS9 (test pyramid) → WS10 (canonical re-validation + separate final release) → WS11 (qa/ finalization).

## [1.51.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 #13 + #14 + #18 + #19 + #20 — feedback / i18n sweep (auto + evaluate).**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y/ux): pending feedback, actionable errors, real clipboard, status regions`**:
  - **#13** `#/auto` Run button was disabled with an unchanged label → no pending cue for the multi-second pipeline. It now shows a busy state (`is-loading` + `aria-busy` + "⏳ Running…"), restored in `finally`.
  - **#14** the HTTP-failure branch put a bare "HTTP 500" on step 1 with no toast and an empty live region. Now an actionable, i18n'd message (`auto.httpFail`, `{n}`-substituted) on the step **and** a toast.
  - **#18** the manual-mode "Copy prompt" used deprecated `document.execCommand('copy')` and always toasted "Copied" even when it silently no-op'd. Now prefers the async Clipboard API, falls back to `execCommand`, and toasts a real failure (`auto.copyFail`) instead of a false success.
  - **#19** `#/evaluate` `#eval-out` had no live role — the long LLM call was silent for screen readers. Now `role="status" aria-live="polite"` so "Evaluating…", the verdict, and errors are announced.
  - **#20** the Evaluate button was a plain `onClick: run` (enabled during the call → duplicate submissions). Now `UI.withSpinner`-wrapped (disables + busy state).

### 🌐 i18n

- 3 new keys × 8 locales — `auto.running`, `auto.httpFail` (`{n}` preserved), `auto.copyFail`. `i18n-coverage` gate green.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/feedback-i18n-sweep.test.mjs`** — 6 cases (busy state + restore, actionable+toasted HTTP fail, async-clipboard fallback, eval status region, eval spinner-wrap, 3 i18n keys ×8). 691 → 697.
- **`fix(test): e2e pipeline-delete teardown`** (commit 7f8e250) — `e2e.mjs` / `e2e-comprehensive.mjs` deleted the test row via the pre-v1.48 native-confirm path; v1.48.0's focus-trapped `UI.confirm()` left the modal open and its backdrop blocked later flows (CI Playwright-e2e red). Teardown is now an API DELETE. Not a product regression — tests predated the confirm gate.

## [1.50.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 #12 + #27 + #28 — help navigation accessibility.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y): help — single h1, labelled+filterable TOC, focus-on-anchor, back-to-top`** — three `#/help` findings on a 17-section / 90+-heading guide:
  - **#28** the doc markdown opened with its own `# Title`, producing a SECOND `<h1>` on a page whose header already supplies the canonical h1 (and a h1→h3 jump in some locales). Every article `<h1>` is now stripped, so there is exactly one h1 and the hierarchy starts cleanly at the `<h2>` sections.
  - **#27** the TOC `<nav>` was an unnamed landmark (two unlabeled `<nav>`s on the page); it now has `aria-label` (`help.toc`). Clicking a TOC entry no longer just scrolls the viewport — focus moves to the section heading (`tabindex=-1` + `focus()`), so keyboard/SR users land in the section.
  - **#12** no way to find anything in a long doc. A `type="search"` filter above the TOC narrows entries by heading text live; a floating, `aria-label`led **Back to top** button appears after scrolling, returns to top and moves focus back to the page `<h1>`. Its scroll listener is removed on `hashchange` away from `#/help` (no leak).

### 🌐 i18n

- 2 new keys × 8 locales — `help.tocFilter`, `help.backToTop`. `i18n-coverage` gate green.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/help-nav-a11y.test.mjs`** — 6 cases (h1 strip, labelled nav, focus-on-anchor, filter narrows, back-to-top + listener cleanup, 2 i18n keys ×8). 685 → 691. Playwright-verified: 1 h1, TOC `aria-label`, filter narrows 17→1 on "scan", 0 console errors.

## [1.49.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 #10 + #11 + #25 + #26 — tracker table accessibility & sort.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y): tracker headers, sortable table, localized fix labels, empty state`** — four `#/tracker` findings:
  - **#10** the action column header was an empty string and the per-row Report button had no context. Every `<th>` now has `scope="col"`; the action header is `t('track.col.actions')`; `Score`/`PDF` headers are i18n-keyed (were hardcoded English); the Report button gains an `aria-label` (`<report> — <company>`).
  - **#11** a job tracker with no way to sort. Date / Score / Status headers are now keyboard-operable sort buttons inside the `<th>` with `aria-sort` (`none`/`ascending`/`descending`); a `sorted()` comparator (numeric for score, locale-compare for date/status) runs before pagination; clicking toggles direction and resets the pager.
  - **#25** `track.normalize/dedup/merge` were identical English in all 8 locales despite being the highest-stakes destructive controls — now properly localized, plus a `title` tooltip (`Rewrites data/applications.md in place`).
  - **#26** a zero-row first run showed the same "no match" message as an over-filtered list. `rows.length === 0` now renders a distinct empty state (title + body + "Open pipeline" CTA); the filter-excluded-everything case keeps `track.noMatch`.

### 🌐 i18n

- 7 new keys × 8 locales (`track.col.score/pdf/actions`, `track.fixHint`, `track.emptyTitle/Body/Cta`) + 3 re-localized (`track.normalize/dedup/merge`). `i18n-coverage` gate green.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/tracker-a11y-sort.test.mjs`** — 6 cases (scope + i18n headers, Report aria-label, sortable th/aria-sort/comparator, localized destructive labels + title, distinct empty state, 7 i18n keys ×8). 677 → 683.

## [1.48.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 #8 + #22 — pipeline: focus-trapped confirm + preview a11y.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y): pipeline UI.confirm() + live preview region`** —
  - **#8** all three `#/pipeline` actions used native `confirm()` (auto-dismissed in embeds, not focus-trapped): the preview-pane Delete, the per-row `✕` delete, and "Evaluate first". All now route through the focus-trapped `UI.confirm()` (v1.44.0 infra) — the two deletes `danger:true` (Cancel-default), "Evaluate first" `danger:false`.
  - **#22** `previewPane` had no live role and a fetch failure was stuffed into `previewBody` so it rendered as a misleading `<pre>` "preview". It's now `role="region" aria-live="polite"` with an `aria-label`; failures set a separate `previewError` and render a distinct `role="alert"` block. `previewError` is cleared on (re)select and when the active row is deleted.
- No native `confirm()` remains in `pipeline.js`.

### 🌐 i18n

- 4 new keys × 8 locales — `pipe.confirmDelTitle`, `pipe.previewError`, `pipe.evaluateAllTitle`, `pipe.previewRegion`. `i18n-coverage` gate green.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/pipeline-confirm-preview.test.mjs`** — 5 cases (no native confirm, ≥3 UI.confirm with correct danger flags, labelled live region, distinct alert + state-clear, 4 i18n keys ×8). 672 → 677. Playwright-verified: preview role=region/aria-live, row-delete opens a focus-trapped modal (focus on Cancel), 0 console errors.

## [1.47.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 #7 + #30 + #31 + #16 — unbound-label accessibility sweep.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y): bind every swept form control to an accessible name`** — four UX-audit findings where inputs had no programmatic label (WCAG 1.3.1 / 3.3.2 / 4.1.2):
  - **#7** `scan.js` — the `dry-run` checkbox and `company-select` dropdown had labels with no `for`; added `htmlFor` (matching the existing `id`s).
  - **#30** `deep.js` — `company` / `role` inputs had unbound labels; added `id` + `htmlFor` (`deep-company`, `deep-role`).
  - **#31** `apply.js` — `url` / `jd` had unbound labels; added `id` + `htmlFor` (`apply-url`, `apply-jd`).
  - **#16** `cv.js` — the primary markdown `<textarea>` had no accessible name; bound it via `aria-labelledby` to the visible "Markdown" `<h3>` (`id="cv-md-heading"`) — SR name == on-screen heading, no new i18n key.
- Uses the explicit `label[for]`↔`control[id]` pattern already standard in `batch.js` / `mode-page.js`. No new i18n keys; zero behaviour change.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/unbound-label-sweep.test.mjs`** — 5 cases incl. a binding-integrity check that every new `htmlFor`/`aria-labelledby` has a matching `id` in-file. 667 → 672. Playwright-verified: on #/scan, #/deep, #/apply every `label[for]` resolves to a control; #/cv `aria-labelledby` resolves to the heading.

## [1.46.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 #5 + #6 + #21 + #24 — scan SSE accessibility.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y): scan SSE — live-log region, Stop, run-state, error banner`** — four UX-audit findings on `#/scan`:
  - **#5** the streaming console (`<pre id="scan-console">`) was a bare element; screen readers got no announcement of scanned lines. Now `role="log" aria-live="polite" aria-relevant="additions"` + an `aria-label` + `tabindex="0"` (keyboard-scrollable). A separate visually-hidden `role="status" aria-live="assertive"` region announces terminal events (complete / failed / stopped).
  - **#6** an in-flight `EventSource` scan had no abort path. The handle is now captured (`activeES`) and a **Stop** button closes it (`es.close()`), cancels the result poll, and resets state. Stop is shown only while a scan runs.
  - **#21** the Scan button stayed enabled with no busy cue during a multi-minute crawl. `setScanRunning()` now disables it + sets `aria-busy` and toggles the Stop button across both stream paths (single-phase `streamTo` and multi-phase `runScanAll` — the latter only ends the run on the terminal `done`, `final !== false`).
  - **#24** an SSE failure was a 3.5 s toast only. A persistent `role="alert"` banner now shows the error with a **Retry scan** action (re-invokes the last run fn); cleared on the next run.
- All side-effecting closures keep the existing `__cancelActiveScanPoll()` hashchange cleanup.

### 🌐 i18n

- 8 new keys × 8 locales — `scan.consoleLabel/stop/stopped/statusDone/statusFailed/statusStopped/errBannerTitle/errRetry`. `i18n-coverage` gate green.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/scan-sse-a11y.test.mjs`** — 7 cases (log-region roles, assertive status, Stop closes EventSource on both paths, run-state aria-busy, persistent alert + Retry, terminal-done gating, 8 i18n keys ×8). 660 → 667.

## [1.45.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 #3 — config tabs: full WAI-ARIA Tabs pattern.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y): config.js tabs implement role=tablist/tab/tabpanel`** — the three #/config tabs (API keys / Profile / Modes) were plain `<button class="tab-btn">` with click-only activation: no `role`, no `aria-selected`, no keyboard model (UX-audit HIGH #3, WCAG 4.1.2 / 2.1.1). Now: a `role="tablist"` container with an `aria-label`; each tab `role="tab"` + `id` + `aria-controls` + `aria-selected` (synced in `activate()`) + roving `tabindex` (0 active / -1 rest); the panel `role="tabpanel"` + `tabindex="0"` + `aria-labelledby` tracking the active tab. Full keyboard nav: ←/→/↑/↓ (wrapping) + Home/End move focus AND activate. The legacy `.tab-btn.is-active` CSS hook is preserved. Verified live: ArrowRight API→Profile syncs aria-selected + panel labelledby; End→Modes; 0 console errors.

### 🌐 i18n

- 1 new key × 8 locales — `config.tablistLabel` ("Settings sections"). `i18n-coverage` gate green.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/config-tabs-aria.test.mjs`** — 7 cases (tablist/tab/tabpanel roles, aria-controls + roving tabindex, activate() aria-selected sync, keyboard map incl. wrap + preventDefault + focus move, legacy textContent-toggle removed, i18n key ×8). Total 653 → 660.
- **`fix(test): retarget 2 stale auto-pipeline smoke tests`** (commit 5d253ba) — the pre-v1.34 Playwright-e2e smoke tests asserted a transient modal the dashboard "Auto-pipeline" button stopped opening in v1.34.0 (→ `Router.go('/auto')`); they had been red on the separate Playwright-e2e CI job for 10 releases. Retargeted to the #/auto screen. Local smoke 16/16; CI green.

## [1.44.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 #4 + #9 — focus-trapped confirmation for destructive parent writes.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y/safety): UI.confirm() gate before whole-file parent overwrites`** — two UX-audit HIGHs, both data-loss: (#4) `config.js` `saveProfileRaw`/`saveModesRaw` replaced the ENTIRE parent `config/profile.yml` / `modes/_profile.md` with no confirmation; (#9) `tracker.js` Normalize/Dedup/Merge rewrote parent `data/applications.md` in place with no confirmation. Added `UI.confirm(title, message, opts)` to `public/js/api.js` — a **focus-trapped** dialog reusing the existing WAI-ARIA modal infra (focus-return, Tab-trap), returning `Promise<boolean>`. A new `_onClose` hook fires from `closeModal()` so EVERY dismissal path (Esc / backdrop / × / Cancel) resolves `false`; only the explicit confirm button resolves `true`. Focus defaults to **Cancel** (safe choice for a destructive op). NOT native `confirm()` (auto-dismissed in embeds, not focus-trapped). All three call sites are now gated before the `API.put`/`API.post`. Verified live: Normalize → focus-trapped "Переписать applications.md?" modal, focus on Cancel, Cancel dismisses with no POST, 0 console errors.

### 🌐 i18n

- 8 new keys × 8 locales — `common.confirm`, `config.rawConfirmTitle/Ok`, `config.profileRawConfirmBody`, `config.modesRawConfirmBody`, `track.fixConfirmTitle/Body/Ok`. The `{op}` placeholder in `track.fixConfirmBody` is preserved verbatim across all locales (runtime-substituted). `i18n-coverage` gate green.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/confirm-gate.test.mjs`** — 8 cases: `UI.confirm` exported, `_onClose` resolves false on every dismissal path, Cancel-default focus, `modal()` back-compat onClose arg, all 3 destructive sites gated before their write, no native `confirm()` left, 8 i18n keys present with `{op}` intact. 644 → 652.

## [1.43.0] — 2026-05-18

**User-requested — `career-ops-ui open` + autostart browser-raise.**

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(cli): career-ops-ui open — open AND raise the dashboard tab`** — after `setup`/`run`, bare `open`/`xdg-open` left the dashboard tab in the background when the browser was already running, so the user had to hunt for it. New `scripts/open-dashboard.mjs` builds the URL from HOST/PORT (rewriting a `0.0.0.0` bind to loopback), optionally waits for `/api/health`, opens the default browser, then **force-raises** it — macOS `osascript` activating whichever of Chrome/Brave/Edge/Safari/Arc/Firefox is running, Linux `xdg-open`+`wmctrl`, Windows `start`. Exposed as the `career-ops-ui open` verb (aliases `dash`, `focus`). `bin/start.sh` autostart now delegates to it so the tab is raised automatically; `NO_OPEN=1` disables auto-open for headless/CI starts. Verified live: `career-ops-ui open` → URL printed, browser raised, exit 0.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/open-dashboard.test.mjs`** — 8 cases: `dashboardUrl` (defaults / PORT / `0.0.0.0`→loopback / explicit HOST), `openAndRaise` platform routing (darwin/win32/linux, no real browser), `waitForHealth` bounded-timeout against a dead port, and static guarantees that the dispatcher routes `open|dash|focus` and `start.sh` delegates + honors `NO_OPEN` (old bare-`open` path gone). 636 → 644.

### 📝 Documentation

- README ×8 + help-bundle §1 ×8 — the `open` verb added to the launch block + a note that `setup`/`run` now raises the tab automatically and `NO_OPEN=1` disables it. H2-section parity preserved (17).

## [1.42.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 fix #2 — `#/portals` dead-route → config deep-link.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(router): #/portals 404 → alias to config + Regional-sources deep-link`** — `#/portals` was an unregistered route that rendered the 404 view, even though it is a plausible bookmarked/typed URL for portal-source management (UX-audit HIGH #2). Added `portals: 'config'` to `router.js` `ALIASES` (same bookmark-stability pattern as `settings→profile`), so it now resolves to the config view with the **config** nav item active. When a Regional-sources group exists, the view (`config.js`) detects the `#/portals` hash, force-opens that `<details>` group, scrolls it into view, and moves focus to its summary (overriding the default h1 focus) so the user lands exactly on the portal-source controls. Never renders an empty regional group from the alias alone. Verified live: `#/portals` → config view, `is404:false`, active nav = config, 0 console errors.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(router): portals→config alias guarantee`** — `router.test.mjs` static assertion guarding the new ALIASES entry against future-refactor regression. 635 → 636.

### 📝 Documentation

- help-bundle §5 × 8 — a "Shortcut" blockquote noting `#/portals` now resolves to App settings / Regional sources instead of 404ing. H2-section parity preserved (17 each).

### Verification

## [1.41.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS2 — senior UX/usability audit + cross-cutting focus-management fix.**

A 10+ yr heuristic audit (Nielsen × WCAG 2.2 AA × project conventions) of
all 17 routes produced a 40-finding, severity-ranked queue
(`.planning/.../UX-AUDIT.md`); HIGH→MEDIUM→LOW are now shipped one fix per
release. This release lands the #1 cross-cutting HIGH.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(a11y): move focus to the new view on every route change`** — `router.js render()` replaced `#content` on each hashchange but never moved focus, so keyboard / screen-reader users stayed on the destroyed node and lost their place (WCAG 2.4.3 Focus Order / 4.1.3 Status Messages — cross-cutting, affected all 17 screens). New `focusNewView(content)` focuses the new view's first `h1`/`.page-title` (concise SR announcement + correct focus order), making the heading focusable (`tabindex=-1`) if needed and falling back to `#content`. The very first paint is skipped so it never fights the skip-link. Wired on both the success and error render paths. Verified live: after nav, `document.activeElement` is the new view's `H1.page-title`.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(router): focus-management static guarantees`** — 4 cases in `router.test.mjs` (helper defined, heading-target + content fallback, first-paint skip guard, ≥2 call sites). 631 → 635.

### 📝 Documentation

- `.planning/.../UX-AUDIT.md` — full 40-finding audit + prioritized fix queue + per-release ship grouping (v1.42 → v1.51). Drives the remaining WS2 iterations.

### Verification

$ npm run test:ci
# 635 / 635 · ✓ no .also( leftovers · ✓ CHANGELOG parity: all 8 locales at v1.41.0

## [1.40.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS8.3 — docs-actualization sweep + `career-ops-ui help` fix + `askSecret` hardening.**

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(cli): career-ops-ui help no longer leaks shell source`** — the dispatcher printed its header comment with `sed -n '2,12p'`, but line 12 (`set -euo pipefail`) is code, not a comment, so `career-ops-ui help` (and the unknown-verb usage text) ended with a stray `set -euo pipefail` line. Narrowed to `2,11p` (the comment block) in both the `help` and `*)` cases. `help` exits 0, unknown verb exits 2 — verified.
- **`fix(cli): scripts/init.mjs key entry never echoes`** — the v1.39.0 follow-up replaced the cosmetic readline-overwrite mask with a real raw-mode reader: `setRawMode(true)` + a buffered line so typed/pasted key bytes never reach the terminal at all (no scrollback / tmux / screen-share leak). A full VT escape FSM consumes every CSI/SS3/OSC/DCS/SOS/PM/APC sequence so arrow & function keys can't corrupt the secret; `stdin` is dependency-injected so the non-TTY fallback is unit-tested without poking the global. Iterated to a clean AI-review LGTM.

### 📝 Documentation

- **README ×8** — the old "one-command install" section is replaced by a prominent **"Launch & initialize in one command"** section: the curl one-liner plus the explicit `career-ops-ui` CLI chain (clone → `npm link` → `setup` → `init` → `doctor` → `run` → `help`), the provider-wizard explanation, the CI `--provider --anthropic-key --yes` form, and the `LLM_PROVIDER` note. All 8 README badges actualized from the stale v1.22–v1.24 / tests-461–474 to **v1.40.0 / tests-631** (e2e badge made non-numeric to avoid an invented count).
- **help-bundle ×8 §1** — a "One-command launch & init" blockquote callout added at the top of the Quick-start playbook (before "A. Setup") in all 8 locales. H2-section parity preserved (17 each — CI gate green).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(init): non-TTY askSecret fallback`** — `provider-selector.test.mjs` gains a DI-stdin case asserting `askSecret` delegates to plain `ask()` (trim-parity) off a TTY without mutating the shared global. 629 → 631.

### Verification

```bash
$ npm run test:ci
# 631 / 631 · ✓ no .also( leftovers · ✓ CHANGELOG parity: all 8 locales at v1.40.0
$ career-ops-ui help     # clean, exit 0 (no `set -euo pipefail` leak)

## [1.39.0] — 2026-05-18

**WS8.2 — LLM provider selector + OpenAI/Codex key + interactive `init` wizard.**

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(config): LLM_PROVIDER selector + OPENAI_API_KEY`** — `server/lib/env-config.mjs` adds `LLM_PROVIDER` (auto|claude|gemini) + `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `KNOWN_KEYS`/`KEY_GROUPS`; `OPENAI_API_KEY` is secret-masked. New `providerOrder(env)` helper: `auto`→`[anthropic,gemini]` (legacy), `claude`→`[anthropic]`, `gemini`→`[gemini]`. All **6** provider-gate sites in `server/lib/routes/llm.mjs` (evaluate/deep/mode × Anthropic/Gemini) consult it via `_provGate()` — a forced provider with no key falls through to the manual-prompt path exactly like the pre-v1.39 no-key behaviour (zero behaviour change for `auto`/default). `#/config` API-keys tab gains an `LLM_PROVIDER` select + `OPENAI_API_KEY` input. Provider-key set matches what santifer/career-ops actually implements (Gemini = parent gemini-eval, Anthropic = web-ui SDK + Claude Code, OpenAI = Codex/OpenCode CLI side); Mistral/Qwen are model names with no parent env key — not invented.
- **`feat(cli): interactive career-ops-ui init`** — `scripts/init.mjs` is now a real wizard (was a WS8.1 stub): pick provider 1-4, enter key(s), writes parent `.env` via the validated `env-config.updateEnvFile` path (explicit user action, same as POST /api/config). Flag-driven too: `--provider --anthropic-key --gemini-key --openai-key --yes`.

### 📝 Documentation

- help-bundle §2 × 8 + `docs/sdd/CONVENTIONS.md` — provider selector + the 3 parent-implemented provider keys. (Full README ×8 + canonical-docs fold = WS8.3/WS10, the user-mandated final steps.)

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/provider-selector.test.mjs`** — 7 cases: `providerOrder` (auto/unknown/whitespace → legacy, claude/gemini forced), env-config surface (KNOWN/SECRET/LLM_PROVIDERS), `init` `parseArgs`+`buildUpdates` (clamp, non-empty-only), and a static canary that all 6 llm.mjs gate-sites use `_provGate()`. 622 → 629.

## [1.38.0] — 2026-05-17

**WS8.1 — unified CLI dispatcher + `doctor` verb.**

AutoResearchClaw-style one-command workflow. `bin/career-ops-ui.sh` dispatches `setup` / `run` / `doctor` / `init` / `help`; `package.json` `bin.career-ops-ui` points at it.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(cli): bin/career-ops-ui.sh dispatcher`** — `setup` → `bin/setup.sh` (existing one-command bootstrap), `run` → `bin/start.sh`, `doctor` → `scripts/doctor.mjs`, `init` → `scripts/init.mjs` (WS8.1 stub; interactive provider wizard = WS8.2), `help`. Backward-compat `career-ops-ui-start` bin alias kept.
- **`feat(cli): scripts/doctor.mjs`** — standalone health check that **reuses the exact `/api/health` engine** (spins `createApp()` in-process on an ephemeral port → renders the JSON to a colorized terminal report). Single source of truth — doctor can never drift from the Health page. **Exit 0 iff every REQUIRED check is green**, exit 1 otherwise, so `setup` / CI can gate on it. No new deps; read-only.

### 📝 Documentation

- `docs/sdd/CONVENTIONS.md` — "CLI dispatcher" section. help-bundle §1 × 8 — CLI quickstart note. (Full README ×8 quickstart block lands in WS8.3, the user-requested final verification step.)

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(cli): tests/cli-doctor.test.mjs`** — 6 cases: `formatReport` pure logic (all-pass / required-fail / optional-only-fail / empty-tolerant), dispatcher verb-routing canary, `package.json` bin wiring. 616 → 622.

## [1.37.0] — 2026-05-17

**WS7 — pre-commit AI review in the git workflow.**

Per user request: an AI review before every commit. Two layers — a fast deterministic floor that fails-HARD, and an advisory AI pass that fails-SOFT.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(workflow): pre-commit AI review`**
  - [`scripts/ai-precommit-review.mjs`](scripts/ai-precommit-review.mjs) — **deterministic floor (fail-HARD):** rejects a commit that stages a `.env`/secret-bearing file, contains a high-confidence secret pattern in the added diff lines (`.env.example` placeholders exempt), leaves `.also(` in a staged view (mirrors the CI gate), or stages a `.mjs`/`.js` that fails `node --check`. **AI layer (fail-SOFT):** runs `claude -p` over the staged diff when the CLI is on PATH and `AI_REVIEW !== 'off'`; missing CLI / offline / timeout → notice, never blocks.
  - [`.githooks/pre-commit`](.githooks/pre-commit) + [`scripts/install-hooks.mjs`](scripts/install-hooks.mjs) — `npm install` wires `core.hooksPath=.githooks` via the new `prepare` script. Idempotent; no-op outside a git checkout.
  - `AI_REVIEW=off git commit …` skips only the AI layer. Never `--no-verify` (CLAUDE.md hard rule #7); CI runs the full gate regardless.

### 📝 Documentation

- `docs/sdd/CONVENTIONS.md` — new "Pre-commit AI review" section (floor vs AI layer, env switch, never-bypass rule).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(workflow): tests/ai-precommit-review.test.mjs`** — 6 cases over the exported pure floor functions: blocked-path detection (`.env.example` exempt), secret-pattern hits (added-lines only, placeholders ignored), `.also(` view leftover, aggregate floor, clean-diff pass. 610 → 616.

### Verification

## [1.36.0] — 2026-05-17

**WS6.3 — #/config Modes tab: raw blob → per-section editor. WS6 complete.**

`modes/_profile.md` is a prompt-engineering doc (markdown tables + prose), not key→value settings — so section-level editing is the right granularity (not field decomposition). This finishes WS6: every settings surface is now structured.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(config): per-section _profile.md editor`**
  - [`server/lib/routes/content.mjs`](server/lib/routes/content.mjs) — byte-exact `splitProfileSections` (preamble + per-`##` `{ heading, headingLine, body }` via string slices, not line-join — round-trip is byte-identical) + `joinProfileSections`. `GET /api/modes/_profile` now also returns `{ preamble, sections }`. `PUT` accepts `{ sections: { "<heading>": "<body>" } }`: replaces only named sections, **preamble + unknown sections + ordering survive byte-for-byte** (merge-not-replace). Unknown heading → 400. Existing `stripDangerousMarkdown` sanitization retained. Legacy `{ markdown }` raw path unchanged.
  - [`public/js/views/config.js`](public/js/views/config.js) — one collapsible textarea per `##` section (label = `## heading`); Save sends `{ sections }`. Collapsed *Advanced: raw markdown* disclosure retained for add/remove-section + preamble edits.
  - i18n: 5 keys × 8 (`config.modesSectionHint/modesNoSections/modesRawToggle/modesRawHint/modesRawSave`).

### 📝 Documentation

- help-bundle §2 × 8 locales — Modes tab documented as per-section editor (merge-by-section, byte-exact preservation, Advanced raw disclosure).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(config): tests/modes-section-form.test.mjs`** — 6 cases: GET exposes preamble+sections, section-merge preserves preamble/others byte-exact, unknown-heading 400, ordering preserved, legacy raw path, sanitization. 604 → 610.

### WS6 outcome

Every settings surface is now field/section-structured: API-keys (already field-based — WS6.2 audit confirmed `KNOWN_KEYS ≡ FIELDS`, no gap), Profile scalars (WS1 v1.32.0), Profile arrays (WS6.4 v1.35.0), Modes sections (WS6.3 v1.36.0). The raw editors remain as documented escape hatches.

## [1.35.0] — 2026-05-17

**WS6.4 — #/config Profile structured array editors + WS6.2 API-keys audit.**

WS1 (v1.32.0) gave the 14 scalar profile fields a form. WS6.4 finishes the job: the list-shaped fields get add/remove-row editors, so the raw-YAML hatch is now truly last-resort.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(config): profile array editors`**
  - [`server/lib/routes/content.mjs`](server/lib/routes/content.mjs) — `PUT /api/profile` now also accepts an `{ arrays: { … } }` payload (alongside / combinable with `{ fields }`). Allow-listed paths: `target_roles.primary` + `narrative.superpowers` (string lists), `target_roles.archetypes` (name/level/fit), `narrative.proof_points` (name/url/hero_metric). Object rows keep ONLY allow-listed sub-keys (injected keys dropped); empty rows dropped; an emptied list deletes the leaf. **Same merge-not-replace invariant** — scalars, unknown keys, and untouched arrays survive.
  - [`public/js/views/config.js`](public/js/views/config.js) — 4 collapsible add/remove-row editors (string-list rows; object rows with per-sub-key inputs). Save sends `{ fields, arrays }` in one request.
  - i18n: 6 new keys × 8 (`config.pfPrimaryRoles/Superpowers/Archetypes/ProofPoints/AddRow/RemoveRow`).
- **`audit(config): WS6.2 API-keys tab`** — verified server `KNOWN_KEYS` (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY/MODEL, GEMINI_API_KEY/MODEL, PORT, HOST) ≡ client `FIELDS`. Every recognized `.env` key already has its own labeled input. **No gap — no code change.**

### 📝 Documentation

- help-bundle §2 × 8 locales — Profile-tab section documents the array editors (add/remove rows, drop-empty, merge-not-replace).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(config): tests/profile-array-editors.test.mjs`** — 7 cases: string-array merge preserves scalars+unknown-keys, object-array allow-list+drop-empty, empty→leaf-removed, proof_points round-trip, unknown-array-path 400, combined fields+arrays, arrays-only request. 597 → 604.

## [1.34.0] — 2026-05-17

**WS5 — one-click Auto-pipeline screen (`#/auto`).**

The v1.15 dashboard auto-pipeline was a transient modal. Promoted to a dedicated, linkable page with senior-UX scaffolding.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(auto): dedicated #/auto screen`** ([`public/js/views/auto.js`](public/js/views/auto.js)) — paste one job URL, one click runs the full chain (validate → fetch → evaluate → save report → append tracker) via the existing `POST /api/auto-pipeline` SSE contract. Senior-UX:
  - Single primary CTA; **Enter** in the URL field also runs it.
  - Live vertical **stepper** as an ordered list with `aria-current="step"` on the running row + a polite `role="status"` live-region announcing every transition (comprehensible without sight).
  - On success the result card **deep-links** to the saved report (`#/reports/:slug · N/5`) and the **tracker** — next action one click away.
  - Failed step marked red with message; CTA re-enables for fix-and-retry without reload.
  - **No API key → manual mode**: steps collapse to a copy-the-prompt card (no spend).
  - Linkable: `#/auto?url=<encoded>&go=1` opens + auto-starts.
  - Sidebar entry (✨ Auto-pipeline, after Pipeline); dashboard ✨ button now routes here (single coherent flow; the `window.AutoPipeline` modal helper stays for backward-compat).
  - i18n: 14 new keys × 8 locales.

### 📝 Documentation

- help-bundle §1 × 8 locales — new "One-click Auto-pipeline (`#/auto`) — the 21-step shortcut" subsection (full step list + a11y + manual-mode + deep-link behaviour). H2 count unchanged (17) — added as a `###` subsection, no parity-gate churn.
- README × 8 — Auto-pipeline headline feature bullet.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(auto): tests/auto-screen.test.mjs`** — 8 cases: route registration, POST+SSE-drain transport, a11y scaffolding (aria-live + aria-current), manual-mode card, success deep-links, index.html script+nav wiring, dashboard→#/auto routing, 14 i18n keys × 8 locales parity.
- **589 → 597** unit + acceptance (+8).

## [1.33.0] — 2026-05-17

**WS4 — full parent career-ops 1.8.0 feature-parity audit + `location_filter`.**

Audited every user-facing parent commit v1.7.0→v1.8.0 (see `.planning/.../PARENT-PARITY.md`). One real GAP found and closed; everything else is FLOW (parent script we shell out to / inline via bundleProjectContext), CLI-ONLY (parent Go TUI), or N/A.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(scan): portals.yml location_filter parity (parent #570)`** — parent's `scan.mjs` gained an optional `location_filter` block; web-ui runs its OWN in-process `en-scanner`/`ru-scanner` (they do NOT shell out to parent `scan.mjs`), so it did not flow through. New [`server/lib/location-filter.mjs`](server/lib/location-filter.mjs) mirrors the parent `buildLocationFilter` semantics **verbatim** (no key → pass-all; empty location → pass; `block` precedence over `allow`; `allow` empty → pass; `allow` non-empty → match ≥ 1; case-insensitive substring). Wired into both scanners' post-fetch filter step (after title/negative, before dedup/persist). Config-driven via `portals.yml` top-level `location_filter:` — no UI needed.

### 📝 Documentation

- help-bundle §5 (Portals) × 8 locales — new `location_filter` subsection with the worked allow/block example + exact semantics + the "top-level key, sibling of title_filter" note.
- `.planning/.../PARENT-PARITY.md` — full classification table of the 20+ parent commits (GAP / FLOW / CLI-ONLY / DOCS / N/A) with rationale per row.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(scan): tests/location-filter.test.mjs`** — 8 cases: no-filter pass-all, empty-location pass, block precedence, allow-empty pass, allow-match-required, case-insensitivity, malformed-config safe-pass, exact parity with parent's `portals.example.yml` worked example. Scanner-integration regression: 51 en/ru/scan tests green (wiring didn't regress).
- **581 → 589** unit + acceptance (+8).

### Parity outcome

career-ops v1.8.0 feature-parity **complete** as of web-ui v1.33.0. Deferred (PLAN R4 scope-guard): #341 Turkish as a 9th UI locale — parent added TR *mode templates* (template-side); a 9th web-ui locale is a dedicated future phase. Optional/LOW backlog: #602 explicit Greenhouse hostname allowlist (already covered by web-ui's `safe-fetch` + `isValidJobUrl` envelope; slug-based URL construction, not raw hostname).

## [1.32.0] — 2026-05-17

**`#/config` Profile tab — raw-YAML blob → field-by-field form (WS1).**

Before v1.32.0 the Profile tab was a single monospace textarea where name, email, location, archetypes, compensation and every custom key lived in one undifferentiated YAML blob — the exact pain the user called out ("всё в одной куче"). It is now a structured form.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(config): Profile field-form with merge-not-replace save`**
  - [`public/js/views/config.js`](public/js/views/config.js) — 14 modeled scalar paths grouped into 3 collapsible sections: **Candidate** (full_name/email/phone/location/linkedin/github/portfolio_url/twitter), **Narrative** (headline/exit_story), **Compensation** (target_range/currency/minimum/location_flexibility). Full-name client-side required-check before save.
  - [`server/lib/routes/content.mjs`](server/lib/routes/content.mjs) — `PUT /api/profile` gains a `{ fields: { "candidate.full_name": … } }` payload. Server **reads the existing `config/profile.yml`, sets/clears only the allow-listed leaves, re-serializes the whole object**. Arrays the form doesn't model (`target_roles.archetypes`, `narrative.proof_points`, `narrative.superpowers`) and any custom keys **survive the round-trip untouched** — the load-bearing invariant (PLAN R1). Empty field → leaf deleted (no `phone: ""` residue). Allow-list rejects unknown dotted paths; identity gate (full name required) preserved; corrupt existing YAML → 409 (refuses to clobber, routes user to raw editor).
  - **Raw-YAML escape hatch retained** as a collapsed *Advanced* `<details>` — the pre-1.32 full-file editor, unchanged (`{ yaml }` path, replaces whole file, preserves comments). For nested-array edits or comment preservation.
  - i18n: 23 new `config.pf*` / `config.profile*` keys × 8 locales.

### 📝 Documentation

- help-bundle §2 (App settings) + §3 (Profile) × 8 locales — rewritten for the 3-tab layout + field-form description + the comment-loss tradeoff + Advanced raw-YAML disclosure.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(config): tests/profile-field-form.test.mjs`** — 7 cases: arrays + unknown-key survival across a field-merge round-trip (the R1 gate), empty-field leaf-deletion, unknown-path rejection, no-full-name rejection, corrupt-YAML 409 guard, legacy raw `{ yaml }` path still works, value trimming.
- **574 → 581** unit + acceptance (+7).

### 🔄 Migration

No user action. First Profile-tab save after upgrade merges into the existing file; comments are dropped on a *field* save (use the Advanced raw editor to keep them). All data keys preserved.

## [1.31.0] — 2026-05-17

**Parent career-ops 1.8.0 sync — `#/batch` exposes `--model` + `--start-from`.**

The parent project bumped 1.7.1 → 1.8.0. The user-relevant code delta: `batch-runner.sh` gained `--model NAME` (#504) and `--start-from N`. web-ui surfaces both on `#/batch`, completing flag parity (the runner's full surface — `--parallel --dry-run --retry-failed --start-from --max-retries --min-score --model` — is now reachable from the browser).

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(batch): surface --model + --start-from`**
  - [`public/js/views/batch.js`](public/js/views/batch.js) — new **Model** text input (optional; placeholder "Claude Max default") and **Start from #** numeric input (optional; min 1). Appended to the run-control row next to Max retries.
  - [`server/lib/routes/batch.mjs`](server/lib/routes/batch.mjs) — `GET /api/stream/batch?model=…&startFrom=…`. Defense-in-depth (same posture as v1.28.0 `--max-retries`): `model` accepted only if it matches `^[A-Za-z0-9.\-]{1,60}$` (rejects shell-meta even though `spawn()` is arg-array — belt-and-suspenders); `startFrom` accepted only as an integer 1..100000. Bad values silently dropped, not 400'd — the UI input is the soft contract.
  - i18n: `batch.modelLbl`, `batch.modelAria`, `batch.startFromLbl`, `batch.startFromAria` × 8 locales.

### 📝 Documentation

- help-bundle §14 (Batch evaluate) × 8 locales — `--model` + `--start-from` documented in the flag list with the `#/batch` field-name mapping.
- Parent career-ops 1.8.0 analysis recorded. Other parent deltas assessed as **no web-ui code change required**: interview-prep audience split (#489) flows through `bundleProjectContext` automatically; `dashboard/` is the parent's Go/Bubble-Tea terminal TUI (browser equivalent is our SPA — not integrated by design); `modes/tr/` Turkish templates are parent-side (a 9th web-ui UI locale is a separate deferred decision); `parentVersion` auto-reports 1.8.0 via `health.mjs` runtime read.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(batch): tests/batch-model-startfrom.test.mjs`** — 7 cases: model pass-through, shell-meta charset rejection (injection guard), empty-model drop, startFrom pass-through, out-of-range drop (`< 1`), non-integer drop, combined-with-other-flags coexistence.
- **567 → 574** unit + acceptance (+7).

### 🔄 Migration

No user action. The next `🌐 Batch` run with the Model / Start-from fields blank behaves exactly as before (Claude Max default, start at offer #1).

### Verification

## [1.30.0] — 2026-05-14

**`#/scan` results paginator — replaces the v1.12.0 "first 200 of N" truncation.**

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(scan): paginate over full filtered result set`** ([`public/js/views/scan.js`](public/js/views/scan.js)) — pre-v1.30 the scan results table was hard-capped at the first 200 filtered rows with a footnote saying "Showing first 200 of N". Rows 201..N were unreachable from the UI; the user had to re-tune `title_filter.positive` in `portals.yml` to narrow the set if they wanted to inspect later rows. v1.30.0 swaps the cap for `UI.paginate` (the same helper that drives `#/tracker`, `#/reports`, `#/activity`).
  - `PAGE_SIZE = 200` preserves the prior visual density per page.
  - The FULL filtered set is sorted first (boost-to-top is stable across pages), then page-sliced — so a boosted row that lands on page 2 still appears at the top of page 2, not buried.
  - Filter input (text / source / remote / scope / chips) calls `pager.reset()` so the user lands on page 1 of the new filter result.
  - `pager.controls(visible, total)` renders `« ‹ N-M of K › »` with disabled-state buttons when on first / last page. When `total ≤ pageSize`, the controls show only the item count (clean for small datasets).
- Stale `scan.shownTop` i18n key removed from [`public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js`](public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js) (× 8 locales — no longer referenced).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(scan): tests/scan-paginator.test.mjs`** — 9 cases across three layers:
  - **Static-source canaries (7):** scan.js declares `PAGE_SIZE = 200`; wires `UI.paginate({ pageSize: PAGE_SIZE, onChange: …renderResults… })`; resets pager on filter input; sorts the FULL `rows.slice()` into `sortedAll` BEFORE paginating; uses `pager.slice(sortedAll)`; appends `pager.controls(sorted.length, rows.length)` after the table; no longer contains the pre-v1.30 `rows.slice(0, 200)` truncation. `i18n-dict.js` does NOT carry the stale `scan.shownTop` key. `api.js` still exports the `paginate()` helper with `.slice / .controls / .reset` surface.
  - **Pure-logic paginator table (1):** replicates clamp+slice rules and exercises 6 boundary cases — page 0 of 550 → 200 rows starting at 0; page 1 → 200 rows starting at 200; page 2 → 150 rows starting at 400; overflow page=99 → clamp to last valid page (2); filter-narrow to 5 rows while on page 2 → clamp to page 0 returning the 5 rows; empty set → page=0, empty slice.
  - **Summary computation (1):** mirrors `start = page * pageSize + 1; end = min(total, start + visible - 1)` from api.js paginate().controls(). Verifies the displayed range across all 3 pages of a 550-row dataset.
- **558 → 567** unit + acceptance (+9 new).

### 🔄 Migration

No user action needed beyond updating to v1.30.0. The next scan that produces > 200 filtered rows will surface the paginator below the results table. Smaller scans see only an "N items" hint (unchanged from `UI.paginate`'s established behaviour in tracker / reports / activity).

### Verification

```bash
$ npm run test:ci
# 567 / 567
# ✓ no .also( leftovers in views/
# ✓ CHANGELOG parity: all 8 locales at v1.30.0
```

Manual smoke after redeploy: run a scan that produces > 200 filtered rows, navigate `#/scan`, scroll past the results table, click `›` to advance to page 2 — should show rows 201..400 instantly (no server round-trip; pure client-side slicing of the already-fetched result set).

## [1.29.2] — 2026-05-14

**Hot-fix: `🌐 Scan` with `source=both` only ran the EN phase. RU phase was silently dropped.**

### 🚑 Critical hot-fix

User-reported symptom: clicking the unified `🌐 Scan` button (which calls `runScanAll()` → `GET /api/stream/scan?source=both`) returned only the EN ATS phase. The console showed `▶ ATS scan (Greenhouse + Ashby + Lever)` … `✓ ATS done · NEW=0` and then stopped. No RU phase output ever appeared, even with all 5 RU adapters listed in `russian_portals.sources`.

**Root cause** — [`public/js/api.js:156`](public/js/api.js#L156) closed the `EventSource` on **the first `done` event**:

```js
if (ev === 'done' || ev === 'error') es.close();
```

But [`server/lib/routes/scan.mjs::driveOne`](server/lib/routes/scan.mjs) emits `done` once per phase, and the `source=both` branch drives two phases sequentially. The client closed after the EN `done`, the server detected `res.on('close')` → `AbortController.abort()` → the RU phase started but was immediately cancelled.

**Fix — multi-phase SSE contract:**

- **Server** ([`server/lib/routes/scan.mjs`](server/lib/routes/scan.mjs)): `driveOne` now accepts a `final` param (default `true`). The `done` payload carries `final: <bool>`. The `source=both` branch passes `final: false` to the first phase, `final: true` to the second.
- **Client** ([`public/js/api.js:148-172`](public/js/api.js#L148-L172)): `stream(...)` closes the `EventSource` on `done` only when `data.final !== false`. Backward-compatible: legacy single-phase producers (`/api/stream/batch`, `/api/stream/pdf*`, etc.) don't set `final`, so the behaviour is unchanged. Close on `error` remains unconditional.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(scan): tests/scan-stream-multi-phase.test.mjs`** — 11 cases covering both server-emitted SSE contract and client decision logic:
  - **SSE contract (6 cases):** `source=ats` → 1 `done` (`final:true`); `source=regional` → 1 `done` (`final:true`); `source=both` → 2 `done` events with `final:false` then `final:true`; `source=both` → 2 `start` events in `en-scanner`/`ru-scanner` order; static canary that the pre-v1.29.2 unconditional close pattern is gone; static canary that the v1.29.2 `data.final !== false` guard is present.
  - **Functional proof of fix (3 cases):** `source=both` actually emits the RU-phase banner line (proves the body runs, not just empty shells); `ru-scanner` start arrives AFTER `en-scanner` done (ordering); `dryRun=1` does NOT modify `data/pipeline.md` (no phase secretly flips `writeFiles`).
  - **Pure-logic close-decision table (1 case, parametrized over 11 inputs):** mirrors the api.js branch in JS — covers `done` with `final:false / true / undefined / null / 0 / 'false'`, plus `error` with payload/null, plus `start` / `log` (never close).
  - **Bug-forensics (1 case):** simulates the pre-v1.29.2 client by cancelling the response stream after the first `done` and verifies the server's `res.on('close')` abort handler is still intact (documents the pre-fix mechanism for future readers).
- **547 → 558** unit + acceptance (+11).

### 🔄 Migration

No user action needed beyond updating to v1.29.2. The next `🌐 Scan` will run both phases.

## [1.29.1] — 2026-05-14

**Detailed user-facing config guide for the 5 RU portals in help-bundle §5, all 8 locales.**

### 📝 Documentation

- **`docs(help): §5 "Configuring Russian portals — detailed setup guide"`** ([`docs/help/<locale>.md`](docs/help/)): new ### subsection within Portals & sources covers the end-user config flow:
  - 5-row source-inventory table with auth + geo restrictions per adapter.
  - Step 1 — locate `portals.yml` + bootstrap from template.
  - Step 2 — full 5-source `russian_portals:` YAML example.
  - Step 3 — tuning queries, `area`, `per_page`, `only_remote`.
  - Common pitfalls — negative-list collision (with worked example showing the fix).
  - How to disable a single source without losing data.
  - How to verify via 🌐 Scan + the per-source SSE log line shape.
- Universal YAML/code blocks shared across locales; prose translated for ES / PT-BR / KO / JA / RU / ZH-CN / ZH-TW.
- §17 ("How to add a new portal") was the developer flow shipped in v1.29.0; §5 is the user flow shipped in v1.29.1.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(help): tests/help-ru-config-section.test.mjs`** — 7 cases asserting every locale's §5 contains the 5-source YAML, the negative-list collision fix, the disable-one-source example, the 5 adapter labels in the verify block, the 5-row inventory table, the `HH_USER_AGENT` env-var reference, and the 17-H2 parity contract held after the edit.
- **540 → 547** unit + acceptance (+7).

## [1.29.0] — 2026-05-14

**Russian-portal scanner expanded from 2 to 5 sources. Source registry + dynamic dropdown. New help-section explaining how to add a 12th.**

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(scan): 3 new RU portal adapters — Trudvsem, GetMatch, GeekJob`** ([`server/lib/sources/`](server/lib/sources/)):
  - [`trudvsem.mjs`](server/lib/sources/trudvsem.mjs) — Russian government open-data API (`opendata.trudvsem.ru/api/v1/vacancies`). No auth, no IP gate. Normalizes the documented v1 JSON shape.
  - [`getmatch.mjs`](server/lib/sources/getmatch.mjs) — tech-focused RU HTML board. Defensive regex parser, returns `[]` on parse miss (never throws on healthy 200).
  - [`geekjob.mjs`](server/lib/sources/geekjob.mjs) — same pattern as GetMatch. Handles `article` and `div`-wrapped card variants.

- **`feat(scan): source registry — single source of truth for every adapter`** ([`server/lib/sources/registry.mjs`](server/lib/sources/registry.mjs)): one array of `{ value, label, region, configKey }` records, consumed by the scanner dispatcher, the `GET /api/scan/sources` endpoint, and the SPA's source-filter dropdown. Adding a 12th adapter = one entry here + one adapter file + one row in `RU_DISPATCH`. The pre-v1.29 three-place drift (hardcoded dropdown / hardcoded if-chain / hardcoded default) is gone.

- **`feat(api): GET /api/scan/sources`** ([`server/lib/routes/scan.mjs`](server/lib/routes/scan.mjs)): returns the canonical source list with `Cache-Control: max-age=60`. The SPA fetches this on `#/scan` mount and rebuilds the source-filter dropdown dynamically.

- **`feat(scan-ui): dynamic source-filter dropdown`** ([`public/js/views/scan.js`](public/js/views/scan.js)): on view mount, fetches `/api/scan/sources` and paints `<option>` entries. Build-time hardcoded fallback list survives if the endpoint is unreachable. The filter chip in `#/scan` now lists 11 sources (6 EN ATS + 5 RU).

- **`feat(ru-scanner): default = 5 sources, dispatcher loop generalized`** ([`server/lib/ru-scanner.mjs`](server/lib/ru-scanner.mjs)):
  - Default `russian_portals.sources` (the value used when `portals.yml` omits the array) now pulls from `registry.mjs::RU_CONFIG_KEYS` — 5 sources, not 2.
  - Pre-v1.29 the dispatcher had two hand-written `if (cfg.sources.includes('hh'))` / `if (cfg.sources.includes('habr'))` blocks. v1.29 replaces them with a single loop over `RU_DISPATCH` that's keyed by the registry. Adding a sixth source = no scanner-loop edit.

### 📝 Documentation

- **`docs(help): new §17 "How to add a new job-portal source" × 8 locales`** ([`docs/help/<locale>.md`](docs/help/)) — full English step-by-step (adapter template for API + HTML patterns, registry entry, dispatcher wiring, mocked unit test, `portals.yml` enablement); 7 locale versions with localized prose + universal code blocks + cross-link to the EN canonical text for the full pitfalls table.
- **`docs(help): §5 + §7 updated for 5 RU sources × 8 locales`** — `russian_portals.sources` example now reads `["hh", "habr", "trudvsem", "getmatch", "geekjob"]`; the Source-dropdown description names all 5.
- Help-bundle section count: **16 → 17** (CI parity contract bumped accordingly).

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(sources): tests/sources-trudvsem.test.mjs`** — 6 cases: normalization, `удалённо`→remote inference, `onlyRemote` filter, 5xx propagation, empty results = no throw, null-record safety.
- **`test(sources): tests/sources-getmatch-geekjob.test.mjs`** — 11 cases across both HTML scrapers: fixture-driven card extraction, nav-anchor skip, empty/null safety, 5xx propagation, `onlyRemote` filter.
- **`test(scan): tests/scan-sources-endpoint.test.mjs`** — 4 cases: shape, RU-source list parity (5 entries), EN-source list parity (6 entries), `Cache-Control` header.
- **`test(ru-scanner): tests/ru-scanner.test.mjs`** — e2e dispatcher test extended to mock all 5 sources.
- **`test(canonical-docs): 17-H2 parity contract`** ([`tests/canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs`](tests/canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs)) and **`tests/help-ui.test.mjs`** — both lifted 16 → 17.
- **520 → 540** unit + acceptance (+ 20 new). Playwright 32/32 unchanged.

For the new RU adapters to fire on your stand, the parent project's `portals.yml` must list them:

```yaml
russian_portals:
  sources: ["hh", "habr", "trudvsem", "getmatch", "geekjob"]
  area: 113
  per_page: 50
  only_remote: false
  queries:
    - "Senior PHP"
    - "Senior Go"
```

If your `portals.yml` has NO `russian_portals.sources:` line at all, the v1.29.0 default kicks in and all 5 sources run automatically. If `sources:` IS present (as in the pre-v1.29 setup), it's used verbatim and you must update it manually — the web-ui never edits parent-project files.

Also note: a global `title_filter.negative: ["php"]` will neutralize every `Senior PHP` query. The scanner emits a stderr warning at scan time (collision detector from v1.13). Adjust the negative list if you see "0 hits" but expected results.

### Verification

```bash
$ npm run test:ci
# 540 / 540
# ✓ no .also( leftovers in views/
# ✓ CHANGELOG parity: all 8 locales at v1.29.0

## [1.28.1] — 2026-05-14

**Hot-fix: router 404 on hashes with `?query`. HH_USER_AGENT row pruned from health.**

### 🚑 Critical hot-fix

- **`fix(router): strip ?query before route lookup`** ([`public/js/router.js`](public/js/router.js)) — pre-v1.28.1 `Router.go('/evaluate?url=…')` produced a hash whose first `split('/')` segment was the whole `"evaluate?url=…"` literal, which never matched a registered route → `__not_found__` (404). Two reported failures had this single root cause:
  - `#/pipeline → ▶` button (`pipeline.js:145`: `Router.go('/evaluate?url=' + encodeURIComponent(url))`).
  - "App settings → Modes" deep link (`settings.js:80`: `href="#/config?tab=modes"`).
  Fix is one line: `hash.split('?')[0]` before the route-name split. The view itself continues to parse query strings via `window.location.hash.split('?')[1]` + `URLSearchParams` (see `evaluate.js`, `config.js`).

### 🧹 Cleanup

- **`fix(health): remove HH_USER_AGENT optional row`** ([`server/lib/routes/health.mjs:54`](server/lib/routes/health.mjs#L54)) — the row surfaced `"unset (hh.ru may 403 from non-RU IPs)"` on every Health page render, including for users who never scan hh.ru. The hh.ru adapter falls back to a baked-in UA when the env var is unset; the 403-from-non-RU gate is still documented in `docs/help/<locale>.md §16` (troubleshooting) and `server/lib/ru-scanner.mjs` still emits a stderr hint at scan time. Removing the row reduces dashboard noise without losing any diagnostic.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(router): tests/router-query-string.test.mjs`** — 3 cases: static-source canary (`router.js` must split off `?` before name lookup), explainer-comment canary (the v1.28.1 fix rationale stays in the source), and pure-logic simulation of `current()` over four representative hashes (`#/evaluate?url=…`, `#/config?tab=modes`, `#/reports/abc-123`, `#/dashboard`).
- **`test(health): tests/health-no-hh-user-agent-row.test.mjs`** — 2 cases: regression guard that `/api/health` no longer surfaces `HH_USER_AGENT` row; sanity that adjacent optional rows survived the prune.
- **515 → 520** unit + acceptance (+ 5 new). Playwright 32/32 unchanged.

### Verification

```bash
$ npm run test:ci
# 520 / 520
# ✓ no .also( leftovers in views/
# ✓ CHANGELOG parity: all 8 locales at v1.28.1

# Manual smoke (after redeploy):

## [1.28.0] — 2026-05-14

**Docs alignment + `#/batch` `--max-retries N` UI surface.** Closes two open backlog items raised by `qa/QA-PROMPT-docs-vs-app.md`.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(batch): surface --max-retries N control on #/batch`** ([Issue #2](https://github.com/Fighter90/career-ops-ui/issues/2)) — the canonical [batch-evaluate-offers](https://career-ops.org/docs/introduction/guides/batch-evaluate-offers) guide documents `--max-retries N` (default 2) but pre-v1.28 the SPA had no way to set it; users were stuck on the runner default.
  - [`public/js/views/batch.js`](public/js/views/batch.js) — new numeric input (1..10), disabled by default, enables only when "Retry failed" is checked. Clears its value when retry is unchecked so an orphaned value can't leak into the next run.
  - [`server/lib/routes/batch.mjs`](server/lib/routes/batch.mjs) — `GET /api/stream/batch?retry=1&maxRetries=N`: parses via `parseInt`, range-validates `1 ≤ N ≤ 10`, silently drops out-of-range/non-integer values (UI is the hard contract; server is defense-in-depth). No-op without `--retry-failed`.
  - i18n: 2 new keys × 8 locales (`batch.maxRetriesLbl`, `batch.maxRetriesAria`) in [`public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js`](public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js).

### 📝 Documentation

- **`docs: align AI-assistant list to career-ops.org/docs canonical`** ([Issue #1](https://github.com/Fighter90/career-ops-ui/issues/1)) — the upstream Quick Start lists Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode / Qwen CLI. Pre-v1.28 we drifted to Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / Gemini CLI / GitHub Copilot CLI, identically across all 8 locales. Resolution: aligned downstream.
  - 8 help-bundles ([`docs/help/<locale>.md`](docs/help/)) — intro paragraph + comparison-table row both now match upstream canonical. One-liner appended: *"other Claude-compatible CLIs work too via the same slash-command surface"*, localized per locale.
  - 8 READMEs ([`README*.md`](README.md)) — intro paragraph aligned with the same one-liner. The "Multi-CLI" feature bullet (about web-ui's own `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`GEMINI.md` shim files, not about career-ops upstream) deliberately retains its wider list (Cursor / Aider / Gemini CLI) since those CLIs do drive our shims.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(canonical-docs): AI-list regression canaries`** — 2 new canaries in [`tests/canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs`](tests/canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs):
  - Every help-bundle + README must contain "OpenCode" and "Qwen CLI".
  - No help-bundle or README may contain the pre-v1.28 stale phrase "Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI" (Latin or CJK delimiter).
- **`test(batch): tests/batch-max-retries.test.mjs`** — 7 cases covering: present (`maxRetries=3` → flag appended), out-of-range upper (`=11` → dropped), out-of-range lower (`=0` → dropped), non-integer (`=abc` → dropped), without `retry=1` (always dropped), no-param (runner default 2 wins), combined-with-all-other-flags.
- **506 → 515** unit + acceptance tests (+ 7 max-retries + 2 AI-list canaries). Playwright 32/32 unchanged.

### 📒 Deferred (unchanged)

- **G-005** A-G → A-F report-block realignment — still requires a coordinated commit on the parent [`santifer/career-ops`](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops) `modes/oferta.md`. Tracked in `qa/REGRESSION-v1.27.md §11`.

## [1.27.0] — 2026-05-14

**Cosmetic + a11y polish: deduplicate sidebar `#/dashboard` entry.**

### 🩹 Cosmetic / a11y

- **`fix(sidebar): dedupe #/dashboard entry`** ([`public/index.html:25-32`](public/index.html#L25-L32)) — the brand logo block (`<a class="logo" href="#/dashboard">`) and the first nav item (`<a class="nav-item" href="#/dashboard">`) both targeted the same route. Screen readers announced "Dashboard" twice in a row when entering the sidebar, and keyboard users had a useless extra tab stop on a control with no distinct purpose. The brand block now renders as a plain `<div class="logo">`. The Dashboard nav item remains the sole link.

### 📒 Deferred (parent-coordinated)

- **G-005 / PR-B** (A-G → A-F report block realignment) — still requires a coordinated commit on the parent [`santifer/career-ops`](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops) `modes/oferta.md`. Tracked in `qa/REGRESSION-v1.27.md §Deferred`.

### 🧪 Tests

## [1.26.1] — 2026-05-14

**Hot-fix: WCAG 2.5.5 — header `.btn` height restored to 44 px floor.**

### 🚑 Critical hot-fix

- **`fix(css): restore min-height: 44px + line-height + flex-shrink:0 on .btn`** ([`public/css/app.css:391-410`](public/css/app.css#L391-L410)) — live Playwright measurement on v1.26.0 found 5 header buttons rendering at 39-41 px (Doctor / Quick scan / Open Pipeline / 🌐 Scan now / ✨ Auto-pipeline a URL) — a WCAG 2.5.5 violation. The fix:
  - Adds `min-height: 44px` to `.btn`. A stale comment at line 427-430 still claimed this floor was in place, but the declaration itself had been lost between v1.18 and v1.26.
  - Adds `line-height: 1.2` so the in-block text doesn't compute the row taller than intended on browsers with looser default leading.
  - Adds `flex-shrink: 0` + `box-sizing: border-box` to keep parent flex rows from squashing the button under their own height constraints.
  - `.btn-sm` keeps its existing 32 px floor (small-control exception per WCAG 2.5.5 + 2.5.8 spaced-target) — `.btn-sm` follows `.btn` in source order so the override applies.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test(wcag): tests/wcag-target-size.test.mjs`** — 4 static CSS canaries:
  - `.btn` block has `min-height: 44px`
  - `.btn` block has `flex-shrink: 0`
  - `.btn-sm` keeps `min-height: 32px`
  - `.btn-sm` defined AFTER `.btn` in source order (cascade)
- **502 → 506** unit (+4) + 32/32 Playwright unchanged.
- Live verification via headless Chromium across all 13 sidebar routes — every `.btn:not(.btn-sm)` measured ≥ 44 × 44 px after the fix.

## [1.26.0] — 2026-05-14

**Test pyramid (unit → functional → acceptance → e2e) + coverage push to ≥ 93 % line / ≥ 83 % branch.** Adopts the 4-tier structure mandated by the v1.25 backlog. Adds 22 new tests targeting the biggest coverage gaps from v1.25's `npm run test:coverage` report; introduces the `tests/acceptance/` directory for cross-endpoint user-journey tests.

### 📐 Test pyramid documentation

- **`docs(architecture): TESTING.md describes the 4-tier pyramid`** ([`docs/architecture/TESTING.md`](docs/architecture/TESTING.md)) — single-source explanation of how the suite is structured and where new tests land:
  - **Tier 1 (unit)** — pure helpers (`security`, `parsers`, `prompts`, `file-lock`, `rate-limit`, `safe-fetch`, `env-config`). No port binding, no FS beyond stubs, no subprocess.
  - **Tier 2 (functional)** — per-endpoint contracts. `createApp()` against ephemeral port + temp `CAREER_OPS_ROOT`.
  - **Tier 3 (acceptance)** — multi-endpoint user journeys. NEW `tests/acceptance/` directory.
  - **Tier 4 (e2e)** — Playwright headless Chromium (`tests/playwright-{smoke,full-cycle}.mjs`, `tests/e2e{,-comprehensive}.mjs`).
- 100% line coverage target is explicitly scoped to **working functionality** — the `if (isMain) { … }` boot block in `server/index.mjs` and live-LLM call paths in `auto-pipeline.mjs` are documented exclusions.

### 🧪 Tier 2 — Functional gap fills

- **`test(jds): jds-list-create-get.test.mjs`** — pre-v1.26 only the DELETE path was tested. New file adds 10 tests covering:
  - `GET /api/jds` shape on empty + populated state
  - `POST /api/jds` with explicit slug, auto-generated slug, slug normalization warning
  - `POST /api/jds` empty-body / stripped-to-empty-slug 400 responses
  - `GET /api/jds/:name` body roundtrip, 404 on unknown, traversal rejection
  - **`server/lib/routes/jds.mjs` coverage: 61.64 % → 100 % line.**
- **`test(auto-pipeline): auto-pipeline-rejection-paths.test.mjs`** — 10 tests covering every URL rejection branch that doesn't need a live LLM:
  - `javascript:` / `file://` / malformed-string / empty / no-key-body
  - SSRF: loopback, RFC1918, link-local IMDS (169.254.169.254)
  - `mode: 'manual'` interaction with rejected URL — error precedes any done event
  - **`server/lib/routes/auto-pipeline.mjs` branch coverage: 50.00 % → 59.38 %.**

### 🧪 Tier 3 — Acceptance (NEW)

- **`test(acceptance): jd-evaluate-tracker-flow.test.mjs`** — first cross-endpoint user journey. Threads 7 endpoints in the order the SPA invokes them:

  1. `POST /api/jds` — save raw JD
  2. `GET /api/jds` — confirm in list
  3. `GET /api/jds/:name` — read body verbatim
  4. `POST /api/evaluate` (manual fallback) — generate prompt
  5. `POST /api/tracker` — add row
  6. `GET /api/tracker` — verify presence
  7. `GET /api/activity` — confirm audit-log entry

  Second journey: pipeline-add → preview → tracker → delete cycle.

### 🧪 Test count

- **480 → 502** unit + acceptance (+22). 32/32 Playwright unchanged.
- `npm test` now runs `tests/*.test.mjs tests/acceptance/*.test.mjs`.
- `npm run test:coverage` same. `npm run test:ci` runs all of the above plus the two CI gates from v1.24.1 (`check-no-also-leftovers`) and v1.25.0 (`check-changelog-parity`).

### Coverage snapshot

Remaining < 95 % line modules are gated by live-LLM / spawn-mock complexity:

- `auto-pipeline.mjs` (46 %) — uncovered region is the live Anthropic / Gemini evaluate path + report-save + tracker-write SSE flow. Out of scope for the 100 % target per [TESTING.md "Goal: 100% line coverage of working functionality"](docs/architecture/TESTING.md).
- `batch.mjs` (67 %) — uncovered region is `streamNodeScript` spawn of `batch-runner.sh`. Out of scope (subprocess mocking gap).
- `cv-import.mjs` (77 %) — uncovered region is pandoc / pdftotext fallback paths when the system tools are missing. Out of scope (env-dependent).

## [1.25.0] — 2026-05-14

**Auto-pipeline manual short-circuit + dashboard cosmetic + CHANGELOG parity backfill.** Closes G-014 (auto-pipeline ignored `mode: 'manual'`), G-012 (CHANGELOG parity drift — 6 locales were 2 releases behind), and the dashboard `✨ ✨` double-glyph cosmetic. G-003 (`README.cn.md` rename) was de-facto already closed — repo only has `README.zh-CN.md`. G-005 (A-G → A-F report block realignment) requires a coordinated parent-project commit and stays deferred.

### 🛡️ G-014 — Auto-pipeline `mode: 'manual'` short-circuit

- **`fix(auto-pipeline): G-014 — honour mode:'manual' short-circuit`** ([`server/lib/routes/auto-pipeline.mjs:158-195`](server/lib/routes/auto-pipeline.mjs#L158-L195)) — pre-v1.25 the route always called an LLM. Passing `mode: 'manual'` (mirroring `/api/evaluate` since v1.10.2) was silently ignored, the request hung 1-3 min on Anthropic. Now the handler:
  - Accepts `mode` AND `evalMode` for back-compat. Either value of `'manual'` triggers the short-circuit.
  - Emits all 5 SSE stages with `status: 'done'` / `status: 'skipped'`. No fetch. No LLM call. No $0.05 per request.
  - `done` payload carries `{ mode: 'manual', prompt: <buildEvaluationPrompt scaffold>, message }` — the SPA can render it like the existing `/api/evaluate` manual-prompt card.
- **Closes DoS-risk** on `HOST=0.0.0.0`: previously, even with `llmRateLimit` capping 10 req/60s/IP, 10 attackers × 10 reqs = $50/min in Anthropic burn. Short-circuit fires before the rate-limit decrement counts toward a real call.
- **Tests** — [`tests/auto-pipeline-manual-mode.test.mjs`](tests/auto-pipeline-manual-mode.test.mjs): 3 tests confirm (1) `mode: 'manual'` returns < 2 s with all 5 step keys, (2) even with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set the short-circuit still fires (the original symptom), (3) legacy `evalMode: 'manual'` callers keep working.

### 📝 G-012 — CHANGELOG parity backfill (6 locales × 2 missing releases)

- **`docs(changelog): backfill v1.23.0, v1.24.0, v1.24.1, v1.25.0 in 6 lagging locales`** — pre-v1.25 only EN had v1.23-v1.24; RU was 1 release behind, the other 6 were 2 releases behind. v1.25 dispatches parallel translation agents (mirrors the v1.23 pattern) to land all four entries in `CHANGELOG.{es,pt-BR,ko-KR,ja,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md`. RU gets v1.24.0 + v1.24.1 + v1.25.0 (it already had v1.23.0 from the v1.23 cycle).
- **`feat(ci): scripts/check-changelog-parity.mjs gate`** — fails the build if any locale CHANGELOG's newest entry is older than the EN canonical. Wired into `npm run test:ci`. Pre-existing G-012 drift would have caught itself the moment it crossed the EN boundary.

### ✨ Cosmetic — dashboard double-glyph dedup

- **`fix(dashboard): dedup ✨ glyph in auto-pipeline button label`** ([`public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js:219`](public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js#L219)) — `dash.autoPipeline` carried a leading `✨` in every locale string AND `public/js/views/dashboard.js:58` prepended another `✨` in the view. Result: button rendered `✨ ✨ Auto-pipeline …`. v1.25 drops the leading glyph from every locale's DICT entry; the view's prefix is the single source. Same audit pass swept the rest of the i18n bundle — no other double-glyph patterns found.

### 🚫 Deferred to a future release

- **G-005 — Report block A-G → A-F per canonical career-ops.org/docs** — requires a coordinated commit in the parent `santifer/career-ops` project (rewrite `modes/oferta.md` to emit A=Role, B=CV-match, C=Strategy, D=Comp, E=Personalization, F=STAR — drop C-Risks/G-Legitimacy as separate blocks). v1.25.0 ships the web-ui side ready for the new schema (`reports.js` already accepts arbitrary block letters since v1.13). Tracked for the next release window when parent + child can land together.
- **G-003 — `README.cn.md` → `README.zh-CN.md` rename** — verified during v1.25 prep: repo already has `README.zh-CN.md` (no orphan `README.cn.md` anywhere under the worktree). The G-003 finding was stale.

### 🧪 Tests

- **477 → 480** unit (+3 from PR-B `auto-pipeline-manual-mode.test.mjs`).
- 32/32 Playwright unchanged.
- `npm run test:ci` now runs `npm test` + `check-no-also-leftovers.mjs` + `check-changelog-parity.mjs`.

## [1.24.1] — 2026-05-14

**Hot-fix: `#/config` crash on all 8 locales (G-015).**

### 🚑 Critical hot-fix

- **`fix(config): G-015 — replace removed Element.prototype.also call in config.js`** ([`public/js/views/config.js:371`](public/js/views/config.js#L371)) — v1.22.0 N-2 dropped the `Element.prototype.also` global monkey-patch and migrated `cv.js` to a free-statement pattern, but **missed `config.js`**. The result: `#/config` crashed at first invocation on every locale with `c(...).also is not a function`. v1.24.1 applies the same migration pattern from `cv.js:188-201` — extract the tree to a `const root = c(...)`, run the activation block on its own, then `return root;`.

### 🛡️ CI gate

- **`feat(ci): scripts/check-no-also-leftovers.mjs sweep`** — walks every file under `public/js/views/` and fails the build on any `.also(` call site (commented references allowed). Wired into the new `npm run test:ci` script. Future revert of the monkey-patch removal can't re-introduce the same regression silently.

### 🧪 Tests

- **`test: tests/config-view-syntax.test.mjs`** — three guards:
  - parse `config.js` via `node:vm.Script` (catches syntax-level regressions without needing Playwright)
  - assert no `.also(` survives outside comments
  - assert the `const root = c(...)` / `return root;` migration anchors are present
- **474 → 477** unit (+3) + 32/32 Playwright unchanged.

### Verification

```bash
$ npm run test:ci
# 477 / 477
# ✓ no .also( leftovers in views/

# Browser smoke:
$ open http://127.0.0.1:4317/#/config
# → renders normally, no "is not a function" card. Every locale equivalent.
```

### Out of scope (deferred to v1.25)

- G-014, G-012, G-005, G-003 — see v1.25.0 entry below for the bundle.

---

## [1.24.0] — 2026-05-14

**Help-bundle content-depth refresh + live execution of QA scenario 31 + RU CHANGELOG end-to-end.** Closes both items the v1.23.0 "Out of scope" table deferred to v1.24: the full content-depth refresh of all 8 help bundles from the 5 canonical career-ops.org/docs URLs (was URL-coverage-only since v1.11.x), and the live execution of QA scenario 31 against a running server (was "needs browser agent + LLM credentials" — turned out 6/6 sub-tests are reachable via curl + grep, only the visual sub-tests need a browser).

### 📖 Help-bundle content-depth refresh

- **`docs(help): refresh en.md from 5 canonical career-ops.org/docs URLs`** ([`docs/help/en.md`](docs/help/en.md)) — pre-v1.24 the EN bundle was 1113 lines and listed the 5 canonical URLs in the front-matter but didn't expand on them in the body. v1.24 fetches all 5 URLs via WebFetch and deepens the matching H2 sections:
  - **About career-ops (front-matter)** — added principles (data sovereignty, AI-agnostic, human-controlled), "What career-ops is NOT" block, expanded concepts inventory from 6 to 10 rows (added Proof points, JD store, Interview-prep, Batch additions).
  - **§5 Portals** — added canonical bootstrap `cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml`, clarified required vs optional fields per `tracked_companies` entry.
  - **§7 Scan** — added "no AI tokens consumed" note for Option A, follow-up commands list (`apply` / `contacto` / `deep` / `tracker`).
  - **§14 Apply checklist** — split into SPA checklist mode vs Manual-vs-Playwright-assisted vs Full CLI flow (canonical 8 numbered steps from `/career-ops apply <company>` to `Submitted.` with `Evaluated → Applied` auto-transition); batch evaluate subsection now has TSV schema table + all 4 flags documented + `merge-tracker.mjs --dry-run`; Playwright Setup subsection lists install commands, MCP registration, alternative `.claude/settings.local.json`, headless-by-default note.
- **16-H2 section parity preserved** (CI test `help-ui.test.mjs::section-parity` asserts exactly 16 H2 sections across all 8 locales).
- **Each of the 5 canonical URLs appears ≥ 2 times** in the bundle (CI test `canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs` enforces). Per-URL count after v1.24: `what-is-career-ops` × 4, `scan-job-portals` × 5, `apply-for-a-job` × 3, `batch-evaluate-offers` × 5, `set-up-playwright` × 3.
- **`docs(help): translate the v1.24 deepening to 7 non-EN locales`** — 7 parallel translation agents dispatched. Each target locale (es / pt-BR / ko-KR / ja / ru / zh-CN / zh-TW) gets a refreshed bundle that mirrors the EN structure section-for-section, preserves verbatim code blocks / URLs / file paths / button labels (📁 Upload CV / 🌐 Scan now / ▶ Evaluate / 📄 Generate PDF / 💾 Save) and English abbreviations (CSP, SSRF, TOCTOU, WCAG, ATS, JD, SSE, REST, API), and translates the deepening to publication-grade native technical style in the target language.

### 🧪 QA scenario 31 — live execution (6/6 PASS)

- **`docs(qa): append last-verified live-execution log to qa/claude-cowork-browser-test-prompt.md`** — pre-v1.24 scenario 31 was documented but never run against a live server (deferred as "needs browser agent + LLM credentials"). v1.24 ran all 6 sub-tests against `http://127.0.0.1:4317`:

  | Sub | Description | Status |
  |---|---|---|
  | 31.1 | Score thresholds in help bundles | ✅ PASS (4.5 × 3, 4.0 × 9, 3.5 × 6 mentions in `docs/help/en.md`) |
  | 31.2 | Scan workflow endpoints | ✅ PASS (`/api/stream/scan-{en,ru}` + `/api/scan-ru/config` → 404; `/api/scan/regional/config` → 200) |
  | 31.3 | `/api/apply-helper` checklist | ✅ PASS (body contains `career-ops apply` + `auto-submit` warning) |
  | 31.4 | `/api/batch` endpoint | ✅ PASS (keys `[exists, runnerExists, raw, rows, additions]`) |
  | 31.5 | Playwright availability | ✅ PASS (`/api/health` reports `Playwright (parent node_modules) ok: true, value: installed`) |
  | 31.6 | Help-bundle URL coverage (5 URLs × 8 locales) | ✅ PASS (**40 / 40 ✓**) |

  Visual-only sub-tests (require browser) flagged separately in the QA prompt — they remain runnable via Claude Cowork or `npm run test:e2e:browser`.

### 🌐 RU CHANGELOG end-to-end (M-9 follow-up)

- **`docs(translate): CHANGELOG.ru.md retry agent — full body translation`** ([`CHANGELOG.ru.md`](CHANGELOG.ru.md)) — the v1.23.0 release shipped with the RU CHANGELOG retry agent still in flight (it had crashed once with a socket error and was re-dispatched). v1.24 picks up the agent's 1542-line full translation: every entry v1.23.0 → v1.6.0 has a publication-grade Russian body, no more EN-bodied stop-gaps. Style discipline matches the v1.22.0 README quality refresh: "функциональность" / "возможности" / "поведение" replace clunky "функционал"; "через" / "с помощью" replace "при помощи"; active voice over passive; "эндпоинт", "лимит запросов", "состояние гонки", "санитайзинг" as canonical terms; English abbreviations (TOCTOU, CSP, SSRF, WCAG, ATS, JD, SSE, REST, API) preserved.

### 🧪 Tests

- **474 / 474** unit + 20 / 20 smoke E2E + 32 / 32 Playwright. Zero behavioral test deltas; every help-bundle CI assertion (16 H2 sections × 8 locales, 5 URLs × ≥ 2 mentions, content floor) still green.

### Verification

```bash
$ npm test                            # 474 / 474

## [1.23.0] — 2026-05-14

**i18n split + connection-banner CI fix + localized dashboard screenshots + every backlog stop-gap closed.** Ships the three items the v1.22.0 "Out of scope" table flagged for v1.23 (M-9 locale CHANGELOG bodies, N-1 `i18n.js` LOC split, help-bundle content audit) plus a hot-fix for the smoke E2E test that turned the v1.22.0 main-branch CI red.

### 🚑 CI hot-fix — connection banner recovery

- **`fix(client): reset health-poll cadence + visibilitychange eager re-check`** ([`public/js/api.js:21-91`](public/js/api.js#L21-L91)) — v1.22.0's M-6 exponential backoff was correct (3 s → 6 s → 12 s → cap 15 s, down from the original cap 60 s) but the in-flight `setTimeout` was locked to whatever delay was set previously. A server killed at t=0.1 with the first ping at t=3 would fail, double the delay to 6, and the next recovery probe wouldn't fire until t=9. The smoke E2E's "Flow 2a: connection banner appears on server down, hides on recovery" waited only 4 s and turned red on `main`.

    v1.23.0 reshapes the polling loop:

    - `_healthHandle` is tracked so `setConnectionState(lost=true)` can `clearTimeout` and re-schedule with `_HEALTH_MIN`. The first recovery probe now fires within 3 s of going down, regardless of what delay was queued.
    - `_HEALTH_MAX` lowered from 60 s to 15 s. Backgrounded tab against a dead server still recovers within one polling cycle when the user comes back; bandwidth savings stay substantial.
    - `document.addEventListener('visibilitychange')` eager-rechecks when the tab regains focus and `connectionLost === true` — Cmd-Tab back doesn't wait for the next backoff tick.

### 🧹 N-1 — i18n.js split (over the 400-LOC target)

- **`refactor(client): split DICT into i18n-dict.js (data) + i18n.js (logic)`** — pre-v1.23 `public/js/lib/i18n.js` was 639 LOC. The bulk (lines 23-586) was the `DICT` translation table — pure structured data. v1.23.0 extracts that to [`public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js`](public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js) (578 LOC, exempt-from-LOC-rule per CLAUDE.md "Exempt from these limits: generated files, migrations, test fixtures, lock files, vendored code" — translation tables qualify as fixtures), leaving [`public/js/lib/i18n.js`](public/js/lib/i18n.js) at 86 LOC of pure module logic (well under the 400-LOC target).
- **Loader contract:** `i18n-dict.js` populates `window.__I18N_DICT = { … }`, then `i18n.js` reads it inside the existing IIFE. [`public/index.html`](public/index.html) loads them in order — `i18n-dict.js` before `i18n.js` — so the IIFE sees a fully-populated DICT at construction time. Missing-dict fallback: every `t()` call returns its inline fallback or bare key, which surfaces a misconfiguration loudly without crashing the SPA.
- **Test plumbing updated:** [`tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs`](tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs), [`tests/help-ui.test.mjs`](tests/help-ui.test.mjs), [`tests/canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs`](tests/canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs) now run both files through the test VM context (or concatenate their source for the regex sweep), preserving every existing assertion.

### 🌐 M-9 — Locale CHANGELOG body translations

- **`docs(translate): 7 non-EN CHANGELOG files end-to-end`** — pre-v1.23 `CHANGELOG.{es,pt-BR,ko-KR,ja,ru,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md` carried EN-bodied stop-gap notes for every entry from v1.13.0 onwards, with a footer pointing readers at the EN canonical. v1.23.0 dispatches 7 parallel translation agents — one per locale — that rewrite every body to publication-grade technical style in the target language. Stop-gap notes removed. Code blocks, file paths, URLs, commit-message-style strings (`fix(security): B-1 — …`), env vars, and link labels preserved verbatim across all locales.

### 🖼️ Localized dashboard screenshots in every README

- **`docs(readme): wire each locale README at its locale-specific PNG`** — pre-v1.23 only `README.pt-BR.md` referenced `dashboard-pt-BR.png`; the other 6 non-EN READMEs still pointed at `dashboard-en.png`. The screenshots (already captured in v1.22.0 cycle by [`scripts/capture-dashboard-screenshots.mjs`](scripts/capture-dashboard-screenshots.mjs)) were present in `images/` but unused. v1.23.0 updates every `README.{es,ja,ko-KR,ru,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md` line 14 to its own `dashboard-<locale>.png`.

### 🧪 Tests

- Same 474 / 474 unit + 32 / 32 Playwright as v1.22.0. **Smoke E2E now 20 / 20** (was 19 / 1 fail on `main` after v1.22.0 due to the banner-recovery regression; v1.23.0's reschedule fix closes it).
- Three existing tests rewired to handle the i18n split. Zero new test files; zero new assertions deleted.

### Verification

```bash
$ npm test
# 474 / 474

$ npm run test:e2e
# passed: 20    failed: 0    (was 19/1 on v1.22.0 main)

$ wc -l public/js/lib/i18n.js public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js
#       86 public/js/lib/i18n.js          ← logic, under target
#      578 public/js/lib/i18n-dict.js     ← data fixture, exempt

$ grep -h 'dashboard-' README*.md | sed -E 's/.*(dashboard-[^)]+).*/\1/' | sort -u
# dashboard-en.png    (README.md only)
# dashboard-es.png    dashboard-ja.png
# dashboard-ko-KR.png dashboard-pt-BR.png
# dashboard-ru.png    dashboard-zh-CN.png  dashboard-zh-TW.png

# CHANGELOG translation sanity: each locale file > 200 lines of native content
$ wc -l CHANGELOG.{es,pt-BR,ko-KR,ja,ru,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md | grep -v total
```

### Breaking changes

None. `public/index.html` now loads two scripts where it loaded one — anyone serving the SPA from a CDN must pick up `i18n-dict.js`; the script load order is enforced by the order of `<script src>` tags in `index.html`. The runtime fallback (empty DICT → `t()` returns the inline EN fallback) prevents hard crashes when the new file is missing.

### Out of scope (v1.24+)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Help-bundle CONTENT depth refresh from career-ops.org/docs (vs URL coverage) | The 5 canonical URLs already appear in every locale's help bundle since v1.11.x and Scenario 31.6 in the QA prompt verifies coverage. Content-body depth refresh is a v1.24+ candidate. |
| Live execution of QA scenario 31 against a running server | Requires browser agent + live LLM credentials. v1.24 candidate. |
| Per-component touch-target sweep on new mode-page hint paragraphs | v1.22.0 M-1 added `<p class="field-hint">` elements that haven't been verified against WCAG 2.5.5 min-height in all 8 locales. |

---

## [1.22.0] — 2026-05-14

**M/L/N backlog clearout + docs alignment + translation quality pass.** The entire v1.20.1-BACKLOG.md medium-and-below tier shipped in one release: nine M-items, five L-items, two nits. Plus a docs-alignment audit against the five canonical [career-ops.org/docs](https://career-ops.org/docs) guides, refreshed system prompts under `.claude/` and `.github/`, and quality-refreshed READMEs in all 7 non-English locales.

### 🛡️ Security hardening (defense-in-depth)

- **`fix(security): M-4 — entity-aware stripDangerousMarkdown`** ([`server/lib/security.mjs`](server/lib/security.mjs)) — the pre-v1.22 regex matched `<script>`, `javascript:`, `on*=` as literal substrings. `&lt;script&gt;`, `java&#115;cript:`, and `<img src="data:image/svg+xml,<svg onload=…>">` slipped through. The strip now decodes `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, numeric (`&#NN;`) and hex (`&#xHH;`) entities **before** the strip regex runs. Validated by 11 tests in [`tests/cv-xss-bypasses.test.mjs`](tests/cv-xss-bypasses.test.mjs). Real defense is still the client-side `UI.md` escape-first pipeline; this hardens the at-rest file.

- **`fix(security): L-2 — bash --noprofile --norc on the batch runner`** ([`server/lib/routes/batch.mjs:108`](server/lib/routes/batch.mjs#L108)) — `spawn('bash', [PATHS.batchRunner, ...])` used to inherit the user's `~/.bashrc`. A hostile rc file could influence the run. Now `spawn('bash', ['--noprofile', '--norc', PATHS.batchRunner, ...])`.

### 🔒 Resilience

- **`fix(client): M-6 — exponential backoff on health ping`** ([`public/js/api.js:22-48`](public/js/api.js#L22-L48)) — the disconnected-state poller used to fire 28,800 fetches against a dead server overnight. Now 3 s → 6 s → 12 s → 24 s → 60 s; resets to 3 s on first 2xx recovery. Setup is a `setTimeout` chain (not `setInterval`) so each step picks up the new delay.

- **`fix(client): M-5 — Safari private-mode localStorage guard`** ([`public/js/lib/i18n.js:572-583`](public/js/lib/i18n.js#L572-L583)) — Safari private-mode throws `SecurityError` on every `localStorage.getItem/setItem`. The IIFE-during-load used to fail the entire i18n module, leaving the SPA rendering raw keys. Wrapped both calls in try/catch with the `detect()` browser-language fallback.

- **`fix(server): M-2 — body-size cap on outbound preview fetches (test + verify)`** — the v1.21.0 `safeGet` already streamed chunks and capped at `opts.maxBytes`. v1.22 adds an explicit regression test in [`tests/ssrf-redirect-rebind.test.mjs`](tests/ssrf-redirect-rebind.test.mjs) to lock the contract: 100 KB upstream + 4 KB cap → response ≤ 4 KB.

- **`fix(client): L-5 — clear setTimeout on hashchange in scan.js`** ([`public/js/views/scan.js:6-22, :113-120`](public/js/views/scan.js#L6-L22)) — the post-done 300 ms `refreshResults()` timer used to leak when the user navigated off `#/scan` in that window. Handle is now captured and cleared in `__cancelActiveScanPoll`.

- **`fix(client): L-4 — multi-line SSE data: joiner`** ([`public/js/lib/auto-pipeline.js:158-176`](public/js/lib/auto-pipeline.js#L158-L176)) — the SSE parser used `match()` (single-line). Per spec, an event may carry multiple `data:` lines that the consumer joins with `\n`. Server currently sends single-line JSON, so the old code worked — but was brittle to any future multi-line payload.

### ♿ Accessibility

- **`feat(a11y): M-3 — WCAG 1.4.1 redundant cues on score pills + connection banner`** ([`public/css/app.css:602-625, :812-822`](public/css/app.css#L602-L625)) — score-high / score-mid / score-low used to convey state by hue alone (red/amber/green). Users who can't perceive hue had no fallback. Each tier now gets a redundant glyph via `::before` (✓ / ◐ / ○). Connection banner gets a leading `⚠` glyph in the offline state. Render sites untouched — pure CSS hardening.

- **`feat(a11y): M-1 — inline hint paragraphs for every mode-page field`** ([`public/js/views/mode-page.js`](public/js/views/mode-page.js), [`public/js/lib/i18n.js`](public/js/lib/i18n.js)) — v1.20.0 wired `htmlFor → id` for every mode-page field but didn't carry inline hint copy; only the README walkthroughs documented field intent. v1.22.0 adds 19 hint i18n keys × 8 locales = **152 new translations** and the `field()` builder now renders a `<p id="…-hint">` with `aria-describedby` wiring per field. Screen-reader users hear the hint when the input is focused.

- **`fix(a11y): M-7 — null-guard on UI.el() htmlFor alias`** ([`public/js/api.js:194-198`](public/js/api.js#L194-L198)) — `htmlFor: null` used to render literal `for="null"`. One-liner mirror of the fallthrough branch's `v != null && v !== false` guard.

### 🧹 Quality / portability

- **`fix(server): L-1 — parseInt radix in health.mjs + bin/start.sh + bin/setup.sh`** — `parseInt(process.versions.node)` without radix triggers a lint warning and is brittle if Node ever ships hex versions. Added `10` everywhere.

- **`fix(server): L-3 — Windows-safe entrypoint check`** ([`server/index.mjs:159-163`](server/index.mjs#L159-L163)) — `import.meta.url === \`file://${process.argv[1]}\`` mishandles drive letters and backslashes on Windows. Replaced with `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) === path.resolve(process.argv[1])`.

- **`refactor(client): N-2 — drop Element.prototype.also monkey-patch`** ([`public/js/views/cv.js:188-201`](public/js/views/cv.js#L188-L201)) — global DOM prototype pollution. Replaced with a local variable for the tree root.

- **`test(canary): M-8 — 404 regression test for retired /api/scan-ru/config`** ([`tests/scan-consolidated.test.mjs`](tests/scan-consolidated.test.mjs)) — v1.20.0 retired the alias but added no canary. Three-line addition mirroring the v1.18 retirement tests.

### 📚 Docs + system prompts

- **`docs(architecture): refresh OVERVIEW + DATA-FLOWS for v1.21+ surface`** — added `safe-fetch.mjs` (DNS-pinned GET), `file-lock.mjs` (per-path mutex), `rate-limit.mjs` (LLM throttle), and `sanitizePathName` to OVERVIEW.md. DATA-FLOWS.md gained two new sections: "Outbound URL fetches (DNS-rebind-safe)" and "LLM endpoint rate-limiting".

- **`docs(readme): security envelope section refresh`** — README.md "Security notes" now documents every helper in the v1.21+ security envelope (sanitizePathName, safeGet, withFileLock, llmRateLimit, entity-aware stripDangerousMarkdown).

- **`docs(qa): scenario 31 — career-ops.org/docs alignment`** ([`qa/claude-cowork-browser-test-prompt.md`](qa/claude-cowork-browser-test-prompt.md)) — six new sub-tests (31.1–31.6) that verify the UI matches behavior described in the five canonical career-ops.org/docs guides: score thresholds, scan workflow (one button), apply workflow (checklist, not auto-submit), batch workflow (TSV editor), Playwright setup (graceful failure), help-bundle coverage (5 URLs × 8 locales).

- **`docs(translate): README quality refresh × 7 non-EN locales`** — every non-EN README rewritten to publication-grade technical style in its native language. Common clunky calques replaced; v1.21/v1.22 security envelope mentions added; release/test badges bumped.

- **`docs(system): .claude/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md + .github/copilot-instructions.md`** — single-file orientation for agents joining a session. Compressed CLAUDE.md, names the v1.21+ helpers, lists common pitfalls.

- **`docs(bin): actualize start.sh / setup.sh / run_all.sh comments`** — "two deps" → "three deps" (express + js-yaml + multer); "298 tests" → "474+ tests"; `parseInt` radix added.

### 🧪 Tests

- **461 → 474 unit** (+13) + 32/32 Playwright unchanged.
- New test files: `cv-xss-bypasses.test.mjs` (M-4, 11 tests).
- Extended: `ssrf-redirect-rebind.test.mjs` (+1 for M-2 body cap), `scan-consolidated.test.mjs` (+1 for M-8 alias canary).
- Zero behavioral test deltas on existing suites — every fix is additive or covered by a new canary.

### Breaking changes

None. Every fix is additive or preserves existing endpoint contracts.

### Out of scope (v1.23+)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| M-9 — locale CHANGELOG body translations | All `CHANGELOG.{es,pt-BR,ko-KR,ja,ru,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md` v1.13+ entries are EN-bodied stop-gaps. Bulk translation candidate after release cadence slows. |
| N-1 — `public/js/lib/i18n.js` over the 400-LOC target | Splitting per locale increases HTTP cost without a bundler. Defer until the build-step decision lands. |
| Help-bundle content refresh from career-ops.org/docs | The five canonical URLs already appear in every locale's help bundle (since v1.11.x). Scenario 31.6 in the QA prompt verifies coverage. Content depth refresh is a v1.23 candidate. |

## [1.21.0] — 2026-05-14

**Security + concurrency + a11y polish from two independent code-review passes.** Seven findings from [`docs/specs/V1.20.1-BACKLOG.md`](docs/specs/V1.20.1-BACKLOG.md) shipped in one release: one blocker (DNS-rebind TOCTOU), six high-severity bugs (path-traversal sanitization spread, rate-limit gap on LAN deploy, concurrent-write race, i18n coverage hole, dangling aria-describedby, missing label associations). 34 new tests; baseline rose from 427 → 461 unit + 32/32 Playwright. Every fix lands behind a named regression test.

### 🛡️ Security

- **`fix(security): B-1 — close DNS-rebind TOCTOU via safe-fetch.mjs`** ([`server/lib/safe-fetch.mjs`](server/lib/safe-fetch.mjs)) — the previous pattern did one explicit `dnsLookup` for validation, then let `fetch()` do its own independent lookup. A DNS rebind attacker with TTL=0 could return a public IP on lookup 1 and `127.0.0.1` / `169.254.169.254` / a LAN address on lookup 2, bypassing `isPrivateOrLoopbackHost`. The new `safeGet` resolves ONCE, pins the TCP connection to that exact IP via node:http(s), and sets SNI/Host so cert validation still targets the original hostname. Used by `/api/pipeline/preview` and `/api/auto-pipeline`. Fail-CLOSED on lookup error (reverses the prior `try { … } catch { /* fall through */ }`). Validated by 8 new tests in [`tests/ssrf-redirect-rebind.test.mjs`](tests/ssrf-redirect-rebind.test.mjs).

- **`fix(security): H-4 — consolidate sanitizePathName across 10 routes`** ([`server/lib/security.mjs`](server/lib/security.mjs)) — the bare `replace(/[^\w\-.]/g, '')` regex was duplicated across `jds.mjs`, `content.mjs`, `reports.mjs`, `llm.mjs`, `runners.mjs` and kept `.` characters, so `..pdf`, `....md`, leading-dot names survived. Only `reports.mjs::sanitizeSlug` did it right. v1.21.0 hoists the correct version (`sanitizePathName`) into `security.mjs`, deletes 10 broken copies, and rejects empty results with 400. Validated by 12 tests in [`tests/path-traversal.test.mjs`](tests/path-traversal.test.mjs).

- **`fix(security): H-5 — rate-limit LLM endpoints on public bind`** ([`server/lib/rate-limit.mjs`](server/lib/rate-limit.mjs)) — `/api/evaluate`, `/api/deep`, `/api/mode/:slug`, `/api/auto-pipeline` previously had no per-IP throttle. Loopback users are unaffected; LAN-exposed deploys (`HOST=0.0.0.0`) get 10 req/min/IP with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-*` headers on overflow. Configurable via `LLM_RATE_LIMIT="N/Ws"`. Cheap interim defense ahead of the v2.0 P-12 auth gate. Validated by 6 tests in [`tests/rate-limit.test.mjs`](tests/rate-limit.test.mjs).

### 🔒 Concurrency

- **`fix(data): H-6 — per-file mutex on applications.md / pipeline.md`** ([`server/lib/file-lock.mjs`](server/lib/file-lock.mjs)) — concurrent `POST /api/tracker` (or auto-pipeline racing a manual add) used to both read `num=42`, both write `num=43`, and silently drop the earlier row. `withFileLock(path, fn)` serializes read-modify-write per path; independent paths still run in parallel. Wired into `tracker.mjs`, `pipeline.mjs` (POST + DELETE), and `auto-pipeline.mjs` tracker step. Validated by 5 tests in [`tests/concurrent-tracker-write.test.mjs`](tests/concurrent-tracker-write.test.mjs) including a 20-concurrent-POST integration check that asserts rows 001..020 land sequentially.

### ♿ Accessibility

- **`fix(a11y): H-1 — id="batch-tsv-hint" on the batch.js hint paragraph`** ([`public/js/views/batch.js`](public/js/views/batch.js)) — v1.20.0 added `aria-describedby="batch-tsv-hint"` to the TSV textarea but never gave the hint `<p>` a matching `id`. Screen readers had nothing to voice. Fixed.

- **`fix(a11y): H-2 — htmlFor on batch-parallel / batch-min-score labels`** ([`public/js/views/batch.js`](public/js/views/batch.js)) — four v1.20.0 inputs got new ids but their labels weren't programmatically associated. WCAG 3.3.2 now satisfied.

- New static-analysis canary in [`tests/a11y-form-wires.test.mjs`](tests/a11y-form-wires.test.mjs) — walks every view file and asserts every `aria-describedby` / `htmlFor` IDREF points at a sibling `id:` declaration. Catches typo-class regressions at CI time.

### 🌐 i18n

- **`fix(i18n): H-3 — 13 keys from v1.20.0 silently fell through to EN for 7 locales`** ([`public/js/lib/i18n.js`](public/js/lib/i18n.js)) — `pipe.filter`, `pipe.count`, `pipe.preview*`, `pipe.openTab`, `pipe.evaluateAll*`, `eval.jdHint`, `batch.parallelAria`, `batch.minScoreAria`, plus `common.delete`, `config.group{Core,Runtime,Regional}`, `config.profileEmpty`, `config.viewProfile`, `scan.atsBadge`, `scan.regionalBadge` were referenced via `t('key', 'EN fallback')` but never added to DICT. Russian, Japanese, Chinese screen-reader users heard English `aria-label`s — directly defeating the WCAG 3.3.2 win v1.20.0 claimed. v1.21.0 adds all 19 keys × 8 locales (≈ 150 new translations) and extends [`tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs`](tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs) with a static-analysis pass that scans every `t('key', …)` call in `public/js/**/*.js` and asserts each key exists in DICT. Future drift caught at CI time.

### 🧪 Tests

- **427 → 461 unit** (+34) + 32/32 Playwright unchanged.
- New test files: `ssrf-redirect-rebind`, `path-traversal`, `concurrent-tracker-write`, `rate-limit`, `a11y-form-wires`.
- Existing `pipeline-preview.test.mjs` rewired from `globalThis.fetch` mock to the new `_setTransport` injection point in `safe-fetch.mjs` — the SSRF path no longer goes through fetch, so the old mock was bypassed silently.

### Verification

```bash
npm test                              # 461 / 461
npm run test:e2e:browser              # 32 / 32

## [1.20.0] — 2026-05-13

**Per-component a11y polish + non-EN README parity + `/api/scan-ru/config` alias retired.** Closes the four items the v1.19.0 "Out of scope" table flagged for v1.20.

### ♿ WCAG 2.5.5 / 2.5.8 — per-component touch-target audit

- **`a11y(touch-target): chip min-height 28 px + 8 px gap (2.5.8 spaced-target exception)`** — `.chip` was 24 × ~50 px (vertical was 24, height failed 2.5.5's 24 px floor for clustered controls); the spaced-target exception of 2.5.8 requires either ≥ 24 × 24 px OR 24 px of clearance. Bumped `.chip` to `min-height: 28px; padding: 6px 12px;` and the wrapping `.chip-row` to `gap: 8px;` so both conditions hold.
- **`a11y(touch-target): sidebar nav-item min-height 44 px`** — `.nav-item` padded only `10px 14px`, computed height ~36 px on most viewports. Now `padding: 12px 14px; min-height: 44px; box-sizing: border-box;`. Matches the `.btn` floor.
- **`a11y(touch-target): tab-btn min-height 44 px`** — same treatment for Sortable Headers / category tabs across Reports, Tracker, Scan results.

### ♿ WCAG 1.3.1 / 3.3.2 — `aria-describedby` on inline form hints

Every form control across the SPA now owns a stable `id`, its `<label>` targets it via `htmlFor`, and any inline hint paragraph is associated via `aria-describedby`. Five view files were rewired:

- **`a11y(forms): config.js`** — per-key `id` + hint association (`cfg-<key>` / `cfg-<key>-hint`).
- **`a11y(forms): evaluate.js`** — `eval-jd` textarea + `eval-jd-hint` paragraph documenting the 50-char minimum after sanitization.
- **`a11y(forms): batch.js`** — `batch-tsv` / `batch-tsv-hint`, plus `aria-label`s on `batch-parallel`, `batch-min-score`, `batch-dry-run`, `batch-retry`.
- **`a11y(forms): pipeline.js`** — `pipe-filter` + `pipe-new-url` / `pipe-new-url-hint`.
- **`a11y(forms): mode-page.js`** — every field across the 7 generic modes (`project`, `training`, `followup`, `batch-prompt`, `contacto`, `interview-prep`, `patterns`) gets `mode-<slug>-<name>` ids and `htmlFor` labels.

`UI.el()` learned a React-style `htmlFor` alias so view code stays declarative — it sets the underlying `for` attribute (which is JS-reserved as a property name).

### 🌍 Non-EN README parity

- **`docs(readme): translate 7 locales to 585-line parity with EN master`** — `README.{es,pt-BR,ko-KR,ja,ru,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md` were 306–316 lines (covered headlines but skipped the marketing-heavy walkthroughs and most of the API reference). All seven now mirror the EN structure end-to-end: About → One-command install → Why? → Quick start (3 numbered steps) → Requirements → What you get table → Scan → Architecture (full directory tree) → API reference (every route table) → Tests → Configuration → Security notes → Limitations → Contributing → 🌍 Getting Started 5-step walkthrough → License.

### 🧹 `/api/scan-ru/config` alias retired

- **`feat!(scan): remove /api/scan-ru/config legacy alias (sunset v1.20)`** — kept as a one-release alias in v1.19 for back-compat. Canonical `/api/scan/regional/config` is the only path now. Removed: route registration in `server/lib/routes/scan.mjs`, doc references in `README.md`, `docs/architecture/{OVERVIEW,SERVER,API}.md`. Tests already covered the canonical path — no test changes needed.

### 🧪 Tests

- Same suite as v1.19. **427 / 427** unit + 20/20 smoke + 23/23 comprehensive + 32/32 Playwright. All a11y wiring is additive (more `id` / `for` / `aria-describedby` attributes) — no behavioral changes, no test deltas.

### Verification

```bash
npm test                              # 427 / 427
npm run test:e2e:browser              # 32 / 32

# Touch targets — every chip / nav-item / tab-btn ≥ 28 / 44 / 44 px:
#   Chrome DevTools → Computed → height/min-height on .chip, .nav-item, .tab-btn

# Form labels — every input has a label[for=…] association:
#   document.querySelectorAll('input,textarea,select').forEach(el =>
#     console.assert(el.labels?.length || el.getAttribute('aria-label'), el))

# Alias gone:
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/scan-ru/config
# → 404

# Canonical still works:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/scan/regional/config | jq '.'
```

### Breaking changes

- `DELETE /api/scan-ru/config` — gone. Use `/api/scan/regional/config`. Was announced as sunset in v1.19.0's CHANGELOG and verification script.

### Out of scope (v1.21+)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Inline-hint paragraphs for every mode-page field | Today only the `<label for=…>` association is in place; visible per-field hint copy is still EN-only in the SPA. The README walkthroughs document the field intent in every locale, so this is a polish item, not a blocker. |
| Color-only state surfacing in `.connection-banner` and dashboard score pills (WCAG 1.4.1) | The banner relies on red/amber/green; needs an icon or text suffix for users who can't perceive hue. |
| Locale-specific CHANGELOG body translations | English-bodied stop-gaps remain in `CHANGELOG.{es,pt-BR,ko-KR,ja,ru,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md`. Translation happens once the v1.x release cadence slows. |

---

## [1.19.0] — 2026-05-13

**WCAG 1.4.3 contrast + scan unification (final) + HH_USER_AGENT removed from UI.** Closes the v1.18 out-of-scope contrast audit, finishes the EN/RU split elimination begun in v1.18, and removes the `HH_USER_AGENT` configuration knob from the UI per user direction (a sensible default bundled in the server already handles non-RU IPs for most users).

### ♿ WCAG 1.4.3 contrast pass

- **`a11y(contrast): introduce AA-passing *-text variants for accent tokens`** — light theme: `--rausch-text: #b80f42` (6.59:1 on white, was 3.52:1), `--kazan-text: #066507` (7.31:1, was 4.53:1), `--darjeeling-text: #7a5800` (5.73:1 on amber bg, was 4.24:1), `--babu-text: #00665e` (6.09:1, was 2.70:1). Dark theme: lightened mirrors (`#ff8aa0`, `#6ee7b7`, `#fcd34d`, `#5eead4`) hit the same 4.5:1 floor on `#161a22` paper.
- Badge classes (`.badge-ok`, `.badge-warn`, `.badge-bad`, `.badge-info`) and score pills (`.score-high`, `.score-mid`, `.score-low`) now route through the new `*-text` variants — every text-on-tinted-bg combo passes AA. The accent fill tokens (`--rausch`, `--kazan`, etc.) stay unchanged for borders and outlines (which only need 3:1 for non-text UI components).

### 🧹 Scan unification (finishes v1.18 work)

- **`docs(scan): scrub remaining EN/RU split references across READMEs + help + architecture docs`** — eight READMEs + eight help bundles + three architecture docs (API.md, SERVER.md, OVERVIEW.md, DATA-FLOWS.md) + scan.js comment now describe a single consolidated scan method. The legacy `/api/stream/scan-{en,ru}` aliases were already gone in v1.18; v1.19 catches the doc/copy that still framed scanning as a two-step EN+RU process.
- **`feat(scan): canonical /api/scan/regional/config endpoint`** — `/api/scan-ru/config` kept as a thin alias through one release for back-compat. The new path matches the source-naming convention (`?source=regional`).

### 🛠️ HH_USER_AGENT removed from UI

- **`feat!(config): drop HH_USER_AGENT field from /#/config + KNOWN_KEYS`** — power users can still set `HH_USER_AGENT` directly in `career-ops/.env` (the server reads via `process.env.HH_USER_AGENT` in `server/lib/sources/hh.mjs` with the bundled UA as fallback). The UI no longer exposes it because the default works for most users and seeing an inscrutable User-Agent field in the App Settings page was a recurring source of confusion.
- README mentions across 8 locales + help bundle mentions across 8 locales replaced with "run via a Russian IP / VPN" advice. The `scan.hhWarning` i18n key was rephrased to drop the env-var setup detail.
- `KEY_GROUPS` collapsed: no more `regional` classification (it only had HH_USER_AGENT). Tests updated; `regionalActive` payload field preserved for SPA back-compat.

### 🧪 Tests

- `tests/env-config.test.mjs` — `KNOWN_KEYS` assertion now excludes HH_USER_AGENT; new assertion that the key is intentionally absent.
- `tests/config-endpoint.test.mjs` — POST-write multi-key test uses `GEMINI_MODEL` as the second known key instead of HH_USER_AGENT.
- `tests/config-groups.test.mjs` — `groups.HH_USER_AGENT` is now expected `undefined`.
- Total: **427 / 427** unit + 20/20 smoke E2E + 23/23 comprehensive E2E + 32/32 Playwright. Same counts as v1.18.0 because every adjusted test was already counted.

### Verification

```bash
npm test                              # 427 / 427

# Contrast (Chrome DevTools or axe) on light + dark:
#   .badge-ok / .badge-warn / .badge-bad / .badge-info → AA pass (4.5:1+)
#   .score-high / .score-mid / .score-low → AA pass

# HH_USER_AGENT no longer in /api/config:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/config | jq '.values | keys'
# → ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY","ANTHROPIC_MODEL","GEMINI_API_KEY","GEMINI_MODEL","HOST","PORT"]
# (no HH_USER_AGENT)

# Canonical regional config endpoint:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/scan/regional/config | jq '.'
# Legacy alias still alive through v1.20:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/scan-ru/config | jq '.'
```

### Out of scope (v1.20+)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Per-component touch-target audit (filter chips, sortable headers, sidebar nav) | v1.18 set the global floor (`.btn` 44 px, `.btn-sm` 32 px); per-component verification across the SPA remains. |
| `aria-describedby` on inline form hints (`#/config`, `#/pipeline`, `#/evaluate`, `#/batch`) | v1.17 covered `aria-label` on global search + modal close. Per-input hint association is the next polish layer. |
| Full non-EN README parity (585 lines like EN) | v1.18 brought non-EN to ~307 (53 % of EN). Marketing-heavy "Quick start" + "🌍 Getting Started" walkthroughs remain EN-only. |
| Remove `/api/scan-ru/config` legacy alias | Sunset planned for v1.20. The canonical `/api/scan/regional/config` is the migration target. |

## [1.18.0] — 2026-05-13

**Scan-endpoint consolidation + WCAG 2.2 AA pass + i18n long-tail finalization.** Retires the legacy `/api/stream/scan-{en,ru}` aliases (Sunset window 2026-10-01 advanced to v1.18 per user direction). Brings non-EN READMEs to ~307 lines and translates the remaining RU-bodied v1.16.0 + v1.17.0 CHANGELOG entries in 6 locales.

### 🚪 Breaking

- **`feat!(scan): retire legacy /api/stream/scan-{en,ru} aliases`** — the deprecated EN/RU split SSE endpoints are gone. Every consumer goes through the consolidated `/api/stream/scan?source=ats|regional|both` endpoint (live since v1.12.0). The legacy paths had Deprecation + Sunset (RFC 8594) headers since v1.15.0; the migration window is now closed. External integrations on the old paths get a clean **404** rather than being silently routed to the SPA catch-all.

### ♿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA pass)

- **WCAG 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks** — new **Skip to main content** link as the first focusable on every page. Visually hidden via `.skip-link` until it receives focus, snaps to the top-left corner on Tab from page load.
- **WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible** — global `*:focus-visible` style. Mouse-click focus rings off, keyboard-Tab focus rings on (the WAI-ARIA AP standard pattern). Modal close (×) gets a higher-contrast focus ring.
- **WCAG 2.5.5 Target Size** — minimum 44×44 px touch target on `.skip-link`. `.btn-sm` keeps a 32 px min-height (which combined with row spacing meets the 24×24 + spacing AAA exception for compact table-row controls).
- **WCAG 3.1.1 Language of Page** — `<html lang="en">` corrected from `lang="ru"` (the JS i18n bootstrap already overrode this on load, but the SSR default now matches the SPA's default locale).
- **WCAG 1.3.1 Info & Relationships** — `#content` gets `tabindex="-1"` so the skip-link target focuses cleanly. (ARIA roles + focus-trap were already added in v1.17.)

### 📚 i18n long-tail

- **`docs(i18n): v1.16.0 + v1.17.0 CHANGELOG translated in 6 locales`** — entries previously RU-bodied in `CHANGELOG.{es,pt-BR,ko-KR,ja,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md` are now in their native language. RU-char count per locale dropped 79 → 42 → 23 (remaining 23 are technical inline references like file paths + the multi-locale header link, which is intentional).
- **`docs(readme): expand non-EN READMEs with Why / Requirements / Features / Configuration / Contributing`** — each non-EN README grew from 240 → ~307 lines. Now covers the same non-marketing sections as the 585-line EN. Full 1:1 parity (marketing-heavy walkthrough sections) remains deferred.

### 🛠️ Misc

- **`docs(api): consolidated scan endpoint in API.md + DATA-FLOWS.md + README.md`** — the API reference table now lists only `/api/stream/scan?source=…`. README's Scan section explains the v1.18.0 retirement of the EN/RU split.
- **`fix(scan.js): drop stale comment about deprecated aliases being live`** — the SPA's runScanAll dispatcher comment now reflects the consolidated reality.

### 🧪 Tests

- `tests/scan-consolidated.test.mjs::F-018 backwards compat` rewritten — the two former "legacy endpoint still works" assertions now verify that requests to `/api/stream/scan-{en,ru}` return **404** (rather than being routed to the SPA catch-all).
- Total: **427 / 427** unit + 20/20 smoke E2E + 23/23 comprehensive E2E + 32/32 Playwright (unchanged count; +2 newly-correct legacy-removal assertions replacing the +2 legacy-still-works assertions).

### Verification

```bash
npm test                              # 427 / 427
npm run test:e2e:full                 # 23 / 23

# Legacy endpoint retirement:
curl -sI http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/stream/scan-en | head -1   # → HTTP/1.1 404
curl -sI http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/stream/scan-ru | head -1   # → HTTP/1.1 404

# Consolidated endpoint:
curl -sN 'http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/stream/scan?source=ats&dryRun=1' | head -5
# → event: start
# → data: {"script":"en-scanner","writeFiles":false,…}

# Skip link (a11y):
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4317/ | grep -c 'class="skip-link"'  # → 1

# html lang fallback:
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4317/ | grep -c 'html lang="en"'     # → 1
```

### Out of scope (v1.19+)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Full non-EN README parity (585 lines like EN) | v1.18 brought non-EN to ~307 (53 % of EN). Marketing-heavy "Why?" / "Quick start" walkthroughs remain EN-only. |

## [1.17.0] — 2026-05-13

**Polish + a11y + CI fix release.** Closes all 9 follow-ups from the
v1.16.0 list: browser smoke verification, README badge truth,
coverage refresh, `lastWorkdayFallback` surfaced in SPA, full E2E
re-baseline, Playwright auto-pipeline scenarios, a11y audit pass,
historical CHANGELOG condensed in 6 locales, and non-EN READMEs
expanded with Architecture / API / Security / Tests sections.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **`fix(e2e): smoke + comprehensive suites re-aligned with v1.16 UX`** —
  the v1.16 Cmd+K Enter → AutoPipeline modal change made the
  e2e tests' `search.press('Enter')` open a modal that intercepted
  subsequent clicks. Tests now use `Shift+Enter` for the legacy
  quick-add path, matching the v1.16 documented split. Also
  updates the comprehensive E2E batch-mode iteration to use
  `/#/batch-prompt` (the legacy mode-prompt slug that v1.15 PR-H
  introduced). **This was the CI failure on v1.16.0 push** —
  Playwright e2e timed out 30 s waiting on backdrop-intercepted
  clicks.
- **`fix(mode-page): batch-prompt route → modes/batch.md via serverSlug`** —
  v1.15 renamed the legacy mode slug to `batch-prompt`, but the
  server's `POST /api/mode/:slug` was then looking for
  `modes/batch-prompt.md` which doesn't exist. New `serverSlug`
  field decouples the route hash from the parent's mode filename.
- **`chore: bump deprecation messages from v1.16.0 to v1.17.0`** —
  the scan-en/scan-ru deprecation copy and the batch-prompt
  deprecation banner referenced the past version.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(scan): 🔒 Workday CAPTCHA chip in Active Companies card`** — the
  server-side `lastWorkdayFallback` export from v1.16 PR-7 is now
  consumed by the SPA. `/api/scan-results` returns the snapshot;
  `#/scan` renders a warn-tinted card above Active Companies when
  a Workday tenant fell back ("🔒 Workday tenant blocked — fallback:
  use /career-ops scan (Playwright)"). New `getLastWorkdayFallback()`
  exporter avoids ESM live-binding ambiguity. 2 new i18n keys ×
  8 locales.

### ♿ Accessibility

- **`a11y: ARIA roles + focus management pass on critical surfaces`** —
  - `index.html`: `role` attributes on `<aside>` (navigation),
    `<header>` (banner), `<section id="content">` (main),
    `<div id="modal">` (dialog with aria-modal/aria-labelledby),
    `<div id="toast">` + `#conn-banner` (status with aria-live),
    `<div class="searchbar">` (search).
  - `#sidebar-toggle` gets `aria-controls="sidebar"` +
    `aria-expanded` synced by JS on open/close.
  - `#global-search` gets a visually-hidden `<label>` plus an
    explicit `aria-label` that surfaces the Cmd+K shortcut hint.
  - Modal close (×) gets `aria-label="Close dialog"`.
  - Decorative backdrops get `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - **Focus trap on modal** — `UI.modal()` remembers the click
    owner, focuses the first non-close focusable on open, and
    cycles Tab/Shift+Tab inside the modal. `UI.closeModal()`
    restores focus to the prior owner.
  - New `.visually-hidden` utility class in `public/css/app.css`
    (WAI-ARIA AP standard pattern).

### 📚 Documentation

- **`docs(readme): badge truth across 8 READMEs`** — tests badge
  `284 / 379 / 360` → **427**; release badge `v1.9.1 / v1.13.0`
  → **v1.16.0** then → v1.17.0 via the v1.17 bump. Release link
  targets updated.
- **`docs(readme): expand 7 non-EN READMEs with reference sections`** —
  each grew 170 → ~240 lines with new Architecture / API
  reference / Security notes / Tests / A11y / Limitations /
  License sections in the native language. Not yet at full 585-line
  parity with EN but covers all key non-marketing surfaces.
- **`docs(changelog): condense pre-v1.12 entries in 6 locales`** —
  the long RU-bodied v1.11.x + v1.10.x entries that bled into the
  non-EN/non-RU CHANGELOGs are now replaced by a compact
  "Earlier releases" exec summary in each locale's native
  language. Detailed history stays in `CHANGELOG.md` (EN).

### 🛠️ Tooling

- **`coverage: refresh numbers`** — last published was 95.46 % line
  / 84.06 % branch (v1.13.0 REVIEW). v1.17 baseline: **94.14 %
  line / 82.98 % branch / 93.20 % function**. Slight drop from
  new error paths in auto-pipeline + reports-write; still well
  above the 80 % floor in CLAUDE.md.

### 🧪 Tests

- Total: **427 / 427** unit + 20/20 smoke E2E + 23/23 comprehensive
  E2E + **32 / 32** Playwright (was 28; +4 new auto-pipeline
  scenarios: button opens modal, Cmd+K paste triggers modal,
  invalid URL gates step 1, `POST /api/auto-pipeline` SSE event
  framing).
- E2E suite re-aligned with v1.16.0 UX (Shift+Enter quick-add,
  /#/batch-prompt for legacy mode).

### Verification

```bash
# Locally:
npm test                          # 427 / 427
npm run test:e2e                  # 20 / 20
npm run test:e2e:full             # 23 / 23
npm run test:e2e:browser          # 32 / 32

# Browser smoke (page-level):
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4317/api/scan-results | jq '.workdayFallback'
# null when no Workday fallback occurred; {apiUrl, reason, at} after a 4xx.

# A11y spot-check:
node -e "
const c = require('cheerio').load(require('fs').readFileSync('public/index.html','utf8'));
['banner','navigation','main','dialog','status','search'].forEach(r =>
  console.log(r, c('[role=' + r + ']').length));
"
# Each role should appear ≥1.

# CI gate verification: dashboard-screenshots workflow boots a /tmp
# scaffold, regenerates PNGs, diffs against committed — green when

## [1.16.0] — 2026-05-13

**Auto-pipeline finalization + adapter polish + i18n long-tail.** Closes
all 11 follow-ups from the v1.15.0 REVIEW: server-side SSE auto-pipeline,
`POST /api/reports` primitive, Cmd+K shortcut, SmartRecruiters pagination,
Workday CAPTCHA-fallback, CI screenshot-drift gate, scan source filter UX,
historical CHANGELOG translation (v1.13.0/v1.12.0 × 6 locales), non-EN
README expansion, and a paste-ready trending-companies importer.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(auto-pipeline): server-side SSE orchestrator`** (#1, #2, #3, #8) —
  the v1.15 client-side chained-fetch orchestrator is gone. `POST
  /api/auto-pipeline` is now a curl-able SSE endpoint that chains
  validate → fetch JD → evaluate → save report → tracker server-side
  with real-time step events. The slow Anthropic call (30–90 s) now
  emits a `running` event instead of a generic spinner. Failures emit
  `error` with `step` + `message`. The orchestrator also persists the
  report markdown to parent `reports/<slug>.md` (was lost in v1.15).
- **`feat(reports): POST /api/reports primitive`** — new writer endpoint
  in `server/lib/routes/reports.mjs`. Slug sanitization with path-
  traversal guard (strip leading dots, collapse internal `...`).
  1 MB cap (413). 409 on existing file unless `overwrite:true`.
  Atomic write through `stripDangerousMarkdown` XSS pass. Logs
  activity.reports.save. Tests: 9 cases.
- **`feat(app): Cmd+K paste URL → auto-pipeline`** — pasting a URL into
  the global search + Enter now opens the AutoPipeline modal with
  `autoStart=true`. Shift+Enter preserves the legacy "add to
  pipeline only" path. The canonical career-ops.org Quick Start §7
  "paste URL → done" UX.
- **`feat(portals): SmartRecruiters pagination`** (#4) —
  `server/lib/sources/smartrecruiters.mjs` walks pages via
  `?limit=100&offset=N` until `totalFound` is reached OR an empty
  page is returned OR the 30-page / 3000-job safety cap fires.
  Strips caller-supplied limit/offset so the cursor is server-owned.
  Big boards (Procter & Gamble, Amazon-style) no longer lose their
  tail of 100+ postings. Tests: 6 cases.
- **`feat(portals): Workday CAPTCHA-fallback graceful`** (#7) —
  `server/lib/sources/workday.mjs` no longer throws on 4xx /
  non-JSON / network errors. Returns `[]` and annotates the new
  exported `lastWorkdayFallback` snapshot. Scanner timeline
  continues with the next tenant. Caller can opt back into the
  v1.14 throw behaviour with `strict:true`. Tests: 7 cases.

### 🛠️ Tooling + CI

- **`ci(workflows): dashboard-screenshots drift gate`** (#5) — new
  `.github/workflows/dashboard-screenshots.yml`. On PRs touching
  `public/css/app.css` / `public/js/views/dashboard.js` /
  `public/js/lib/i18n.js` / `public/index.html`, the workflow
  boots the web-ui server against a /tmp scaffold, regenerates the
  8 hero PNGs via Playwright + chromium, and fails the build if
  the result drifts from what's committed. Uploads the regenerated
  PNGs as a CI artifact on failure.
- **`feat(scripts): import-trending-companies.mjs`** (#11) — verifies
  the 13 trending companies in `docs/portals-examples.md` via their
  real boards-API and emits paste-ready YAML for the user's parent
  `portals.yml::tracked_companies`. `enabled: false` is stamped on
  any candidate whose slug 404s. Live probe of all 6 ATSes
  (Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever / Workable / SmartRecruiters /
  Workday). Run via `npm run import:trending`.
- **`feat(scripts): npm run capture:dashboards`** — exposes
  `scripts/capture-dashboard-screenshots.mjs` as a top-level script
  (was only documented in `images/README.md` before).

### 🎨 UX

- **`fix(scan): consolidated source-filter dropdown`** (#6) —
  `#/scan` source dropdown rebuilt from the v1.14 adapter registry:
  6 ATSes + hh.ru + Habr Career, alphabetical, no geo-tag prefix.
  `runEnScan` / `runRuScan` now hit the consolidated
  `/api/stream/scan?source={ats,regional}` endpoint instead of the
  deprecated `/api/stream/scan-{en,ru}` aliases (Sunset headers
  stay live through v1.16).

### 📚 i18n long-tail

- **`docs(i18n): translate v1.13.0 + v1.12.0 CHANGELOG in 6 locales`**
  (#9) — entries previously RU-bodied in
  `CHANGELOG.{es,pt-BR,ko-KR,ja,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md` are now in their
  actual locale. Each non-EN/non-RU CHANGELOG also gets an i18n
  note explaining that pre-v1.12 entries remain RU per project
  convention (canonical text lives in `CHANGELOG.md`).
- **`docs: expand non-EN READMEs with v1.16.0 highlights section`**
  (#10) — 6 non-EN READMEs (es / pt-BR / ko-KR / ja / ru / zh-CN /
  zh-TW) get a new ~35-line section covering: auto-pipeline
  one-click flow + curl example, SmartRecruiters pagination,
  Workday fallback, scan source-filter UX, importer script, and
  CI screenshot workflow. RU README also extended.

### 🧪 Tests

- New `tests/reports-write.test.mjs` (9 cases) — happy path, slug
  sanitization (incl. path-traversal guard), 409 conflict,
  overwrite flag, XSS strip, 400 on missing fields, 413 on >1 MB,
  GET/POST round-trip.
- New `tests/auto-pipeline.test.mjs` (5 cases) — SSE framing,
  invalid URL gate, SSRF/loopback gate, no-LLM-key error path,
  `text/event-stream` Content-Type header.
- New `tests/smartrecruiters-pagination.test.mjs` (6 cases) —
  single page, 3 pages, empty-page early-stop, hard cap honored,
  query strip, 503 throws.
- New `tests/workday-fallback.test.mjs` (7 cases) — happy path,
  403/429 graceful, non-JSON body, network error, strict opt-in
  for both 4xx and network errors.
- Total: **427 / 427** unit (was 400; +27 net). 0 failures. 28/28
  Playwright + 23/23 comprehensive E2E + 20/20 smoke E2E green
  from v1.15.0 baseline.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-05-13

**Doc-conformance release.** Closes 9 of the 10 still-open findings
from the conformance audit (`qa/conformance-vs-docs/00-CONFORMANCE-REPORT.md`)
plus the localized hero images. Brings the UI in line with the
canonical career-ops.org/docs workflow so the same pipeline promised
by the CLI works end-to-end through the browser on every locale.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(auto-pipeline): PR-C — 1-click "paste URL → report + PDF + tracker row"`** (G-007)
  Match the canonical career-ops.org promise. Until v1.15 users did 5 manual clicks across /#/pipeline → /#/evaluate → /#/cv → /#/tracker. Now a single ✨ button on /#/dashboard chains: validate URL → fetch JD (SSRF-safe) → evaluate against CV → generate PDF → add tracker row. Renders a step-by-step modal timeline with [✓]/[…]/[✗] per step. Heuristic company/role extraction from JD first lines. Score + legitimacy extracted via regex from the evaluation markdown. New file: `public/js/lib/auto-pipeline.js`. 19 new i18n keys × 8 locales.
- **`feat(modes): PR-D — modes/_profile.md editor as #/config → Modes tab`** (G-008)
  The canonical "Career framing" file per Quick Start §Step-5 was invisible to UI users before. Now exposed via a new "Modes" tab on /#/config plus a discoverable card on /#/profile. New endpoints: `GET/PUT /api/modes/_profile` with 256 KB cap, `stripDangerousMarkdown` XSS pass, scaffold from `_profile.template.md` on first read. 9 new i18n keys × 8 locales.
- **`feat(profile): PR-E — accept canonical schema; add location + headline`** (G-009)
  `/api/profile` now accepts BOTH the legacy (`candidate:{...}`) AND canonical (top-level `full_name`, `narrative.headline`, `target_roles.primary`, `compensation.target_range`) schemas. Legacy wins when both are present so existing YAMLs render identically. New `summarizeProfile()` helper returns unified shape. `/#/profile` surfaces `narrative.headline` as a new card. 2 new i18n keys × 8 locales.
- **`feat(tracker): PR-B — Legitimacy column on #/tracker`** (G-006)
  Restores parity with the canonical pipeline output table from career-ops.org/docs. Adds Legitimacy column between Status and PDF with badge-ok/warn/bad tinting (mirrors statusClass pattern). Graceful degrade — pre-v1.15 rows without a Legitimacy column show `—`. 1 new i18n key × 8 locales.
- **`fix(routing): PR-H — dedupe sidebar; route #/batch to v1.13.0 TSV SPA`** (G-011)
  Before this fix /#/batch was registered TWICE in the sidebar AND both went to the legacy mode-prompt builder. The v1.13.0 TSV SPA (8 KB, 4 endpoints) was unreachable. Removed duplicate sidebar entry; renamed mode slug `batch` → `batch-prompt` with a deprecation banner. Canonical /#/batch is now the TSV SPA.

### 📚 Documentation

- **`docs(evaluate): PR-A — realign Block A-F with canonical career-ops.org rubric`** (G-005)
  career-ops.org docs document A–F (Strategy/Personalization/STAR stories at C/E/F). We emitted A–G with shifted semantics (Risks/Verdict/Legitimacy). v1.15 updates all 8 help bundles §9 to show the canonical A–F with a "Pre-v1.15 used A–G; we render those as-is for back-compat" callout. `eval.subtitle` i18n key × 8 locales also realigned. Score + legitimacy now documented as report-header fields. ⚠ Parent commit still required: `santifer/career-ops::modes/oferta.md` needs to be rewritten upstream to emit canonical A–F.
- **`docs: PR-F — seniority_boost + search_queries in help §5 across 8 locales + scaffold`** (G-010)
  Help §5 in 8 bundles now documents the third title-filter key (`seniority_boost`) AND has a `search_queries` example block with translated 1-paragraph intro clarifying it drives only the AI-powered Option B scan. `bin/setup.sh` portals.yml scaffold seeds `seniority_boost: ["Senior", "Staff", "Lead"]` by default. H2 parity preserved: 16 × 8 locales.
- **`docs: PR-I — localized hero images per README locale`**
  Each of 8 READMEs now has a locale-specific `images/dashboard-<locale>.png` (HiDPI 1440×900) generated via `scripts/capture-dashboard-screenshots.mjs` (Playwright + chromium). Old shared `public/images/screen_vacancy_found.png` deleted. Non-EN readers see their UI labelled in their language on first landing.

### 🧹 Carryover cleanups

- **`PR-G — G-001`** `scan.noResults` i18n bundle: replaced 8 strings containing "EN or RU scan" literal with locale-clean copy.
- **`PR-G — G-002`** 📄 Generate PDF button now surfaces on #/interview-prep result panels (mirrors deep.js pattern).
- **`PR-G — G-003`** `README.cn.md` → `README.zh-CN.md` (canonical locale tag); references swept across siblings + tests/canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs.
- **`PR-G — G-004`** `/api/stream/scan-en` + `scan-ru` now emit RFC 8594 Sunset + Deprecation + Link headers (sunset 2026-10-01). Scheduled for removal in v1.16.0.

### 🧪 Tests

- New `tests/profile-canonical-schema.test.mjs` (6 cases) — canonical YAML, legacy YAML, mixed legacy-wins, accept-canonical-only, reject neither-shape, comp range parsing.
- New `tests/modes-profile-crud.test.mjs` (8 cases) — built-in scaffold on empty, template-takeover, persisted-wins, write happy-path, sanitization, 400 on non-string, 413 on >256 KB, generic /api/modes/:name still works.
- Fixed isolation regression in test fixtures: tests now use `before/after + dynamic-import` pattern (matching `tests/batch-endpoints.test.mjs`) so they no longer mutate the user's real parent `config/profile.yml`. **NOTE for users:** if your `config/profile.yml` looks like a test placeholder after upgrading from a v1.15.0-RC build, restore from your backup — the regression existed in the dev branch only.
- Total: **400 / 400** unit tests (was 386; +14 net). 0 failures. 20/20 smoke E2E + 23/23 comprehensive E2E + 28/28 Playwright all green from v1.14.0 baseline.

### Out of scope (v1.16+ follow-up)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Parent commit for canonical A–F prompt | `santifer/career-ops::modes/oferta.md` needs rewriting upstream. CLAUDE.md hard rule #1 forbids us editing parent files. Web-ui side is already done (graceful degrade — pre-v1.15 A–G reports render unchanged). |
| Server-side `POST /api/auto-pipeline` SSE | Client-side orchestrator ships the UX win. Server-side endpoint would enable retry-from-step-N + curl-able CI. |
| `POST /api/reports` primitive | Auto-pipeline currently shows the report markdown inline but doesn't persist it to parent `reports/`. The PDF + tracker row are the durable artifacts. |
| Cmd+K paste-URL → run auto-pipeline | Defer to v1.16+. |

## [1.14.0] — 2026-05-13

3 new ATS adapters land on top of v1.13.0's registry, taking us from 3 → 6 supported ATSes (Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever **+ Workable / SmartRecruiters / Workday-beta**). User-facing docs across 17 files swept from "3 ATSes" to "6 ATSes" in one shot (42 phrase upgrades) — README × 8 locales, help bundle × 8 locales, PROJECT.md. Adds `docs/portals-examples.md` blocks for 13 trending companies as ready-to-paste YAML for parent `portals.yml`.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(portals): 3 new ATS adapters — Workable, SmartRecruiters, Workday-beta`** — registry now resolves 6 ATSes (was 3). New files: `server/lib/portals/adapters/{workable,smartrecruiters,workday}.mjs` (each a thin uniform-contract wrapper around the new sources) and `server/lib/sources/{workable,smartrecruiters,workday}.mjs` (raw HTTP + response normalization to the canonical `{ id, title, company, url, location, isRemote, … }` shape with `source: <id>`).
  - **Workable**: detects `apply.workable.com/<slug>` AND legacy `<subdomain>.workable.com`. Endpoint: `https://apply.workable.com/api/v3/accounts/<slug>/jobs?details=true`.
  - **SmartRecruiters**: detects `jobs.smartrecruiters.com/<slug>` AND `careers.smartrecruiters.com/<slug>`. Endpoint: `https://api.smartrecruiters.com/v1/companies/<slug>/postings`.
  - **Workday (beta)**: detects `<tenant>.wd<N>.myworkdayjobs.com/<lang>/<site>`. Endpoint: POST to `/wday/cxs/<tenant>/<site>/jobs`. Defaults `site=External` when the careers_url omits it. Beta because some tenants gate CXS behind CAPTCHA — when that happens, fall back to parent's `/career-ops scan` (Playwright-driven).

### 📚 Docs

- **`docs(portals-examples): trending boards block`** — `docs/portals-examples.md` extended with v1.14.0 section listing 13 trending companies as ready-to-paste YAML for `tracked_companies`, split across Greenhouse-hosted (Stripe, GitLab, HashiCorp, Cloudflare, Datadog, Hugging Face) and Ashby-hosted (Notion, Linear, PostHog, Replicate, Modal Labs, Fly.io, Render). Each entry uses `enabled: false` so users verify the slug responds before turning it on. Plus example blocks for Workable / SmartRecruiters / Workday with the URL pattern that detects each.
- **`docs(framing): 42 ATS-phrase upgrades across 17 user-facing docs`** — every appearance of "Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever" in user-facing documentation now reads "Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever / Workable / SmartRecruiters / Workday". Touches README × 8 locales (EN/ES/PT-BR/RU/JA/KO/CN/TW), help bundle × 8 locales, PROJECT.md. Historical CHANGELOG entries and bug-fix prescription docs (`qa/fixes/F-014`, `qa/FIX-PROMPT`) are deliberately untouched — they describe past or already-correct state.
- **`docs(qa): browser test scenario 19 — 6 ATS adapter coverage`** — `qa/claude-cowork-browser-test-prompt.md` extended with Scenario 19: `ALL_ADAPTERS.length === 6` invariant, `resolveAdapter()` URL-detection sweep for all 6 adapters, soft-check for the Active Companies card in `#/scan`, and structural check for `docs/portals-examples.md` blocks per ATS.

### 🧪 Tests

- `tests/adapter-registry.test.mjs` extended with 7 new tests for the 3 new adapters (Workable apply-URL pattern, Workable legacy subdomain pattern, SmartRecruiters jobs.* + careers.* patterns, Workday tenant.wd5.* with explicit site, Workday default site fallback to "External", `ALL_ADAPTERS.length === 6` invariant, `detectApi()` legacy-shape compatibility).
- Total: **386 / 386** unit tests (was 379; +7 net). 0 failures.

### Verification

```
npm test                        # 386 / 386
node -e "import('./server/lib/portals/registry.mjs').then(m => console.log(m.ALL_ADAPTERS.length))"   # → 6

# Adapter detection sweep:
node -e "import('./server/lib/portals/registry.mjs').then(m => {
  console.log(m.resolveAdapter({ careers_url: 'https://apply.workable.com/foo/' }).adapter.id);          // → workable
  console.log(m.resolveAdapter({ careers_url: 'https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/Bar' }).adapter.id);     // → smartrecruiters
  console.log(m.resolveAdapter({ careers_url: 'https://baz.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US' }).adapter.id);  // → workday
})"
```

| Per-company adapter records for the 13 trending Greenhouse/Ashby companies | `docs/portals-examples.md` v1.14.0 block lists them as user-pasteable YAML; slug verification + bulk add into parent's `portals.yml` is a separate phase. |
| Workday CAPTCHA-fallback automation | Workday adapter throws when the CXS feed is gated; the planned fallback delegates to parent's `/career-ops scan` (Playwright). Wiring that into the SPA's "scan" UX is v1.15+. |

## [1.13.0] — 2026-05-13

Big slice. Closes all 4 deferred items from the post-v1.12.0 backlog in one release: PR-4 (full multer pipeline), Adapter registry (architectural F-018 follow-on), Batch evaluate SPA page, and locale-aware mode-template scaffolding. Plus a mid-session dark-theme table fix.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(cv): multer-based multipart upload (PR-4 full)`** — `/api/cv/import` now accepts BOTH the original octet-stream contract (`Content-Type: application/octet-stream` + `X-Filename`) AND `multipart/form-data` properly parsed via multer. The v1.10.2 415-reject was a stopgap; v1.13.0 is the real fix. External clients (curl `-F`, Postman default, any HTTP client) work seamlessly. Both paths feed the same `importDocumentToMarkdown` converter + `stripDangerousMarkdown` XSS pass. New dep: `multer ^2.1.1`.
- **`feat(portals): adapter registry`** — extracted Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever fetchers into `server/lib/portals/adapters/*.mjs` with a uniform contract (`id`, `label`, `matches`, `buildEndpoint`, `fetch`). New `server/lib/portals/registry.mjs::resolveAdapter()` is the single dispatch surface. `en-scanner.mjs::detectApi()` + `FETCHERS` now delegate to the registry; legacy return shape preserved. To add a new ATS: drop a file under `adapters/`, append to `ALL_ADAPTERS` — no scanner changes needed.
- **`feat(batch): #/batch evaluate page`** — new SPA view + 4 endpoints (`GET /api/batch`, `PUT /api/batch`, `GET /api/stream/batch`, `POST /api/batch/merge`). TSV editor for `batch/batch-input.tsv`, parallel/min-score/dry-run/retry controls, live SSE log of `bash batch/batch-runner.sh`, post-run list of `batch/tracker-additions/` with one-click `node merge-tracker.mjs`. Sidebar link under Decision group. 21 new i18n keys × 8 locales.
- **`feat(prompts): locale-aware mode scaffolding`** — `buildModePrompt` + `buildEvaluationPrompt` now wrap the parent's English mode-template body with localized scaffolding text (role line, "Read these files first", "User-supplied context") in 8 locales. The parent's `modes/<slug>.md` body stays English (read-only per CLAUDE.md hard rule #1); the career-ops-ui scaffolding around it is translated.

### 🎨 UX fixes

- **`fix(theme): dark-mode table hover + tab-btn`** — hardcoded `#fafafa` / `#fff` / `#f7f7f7` replaced with `var(--beach)` / `var(--paper)` / `var(--slate)` tokens so the dark palette swap actually reaches table rows and tab buttons. Adds `.row-boosted` accent strip for boosted scan rows that works in both themes.

### 🧪 Tests

- New `tests/adapter-registry.test.mjs` (7 cases) — uniform contract, URL detection per ATS, explicit `api:` field priority, null on no match, legacy `detectApi()` shape preserved.
- New `tests/batch-endpoints.test.mjs` (5 cases) — empty fixture, TSV round-trip, no-URL rejection, 1 MB cap, runner-missing error frame.
- New `tests/locale-scaffold.test.mjs` (6 cases) — scaffold strings in en/ru/ja/ko, `buildModePrompt`/`buildEvaluationPrompt` integration, English back-compat.
- `tests/cv-upload-multipart-reject.test.mjs` rewritten — what was the "multipart returns 415" contract is now the "multipart parsed via multer" contract; the no-side-effect-on-cv.md invariant is preserved.
- Total: **379 / 379** unit tests (was 360; +19 net). 0 failures.
- Coverage: **95.46 % line / 84.06 % branch**.
- 20/20 smoke E2E · 23/23 comprehensive E2E · 28/28 Playwright.

### Out of scope (deferred follow-up work)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| 14 new portal adapters (Workable / SmartRecruiters / Workday / GitLab / HashiCorp / Cloudflare / Datadog / Stripe / Notion / Linear / Posthog / Hugging Face / Replicate / Modal Labs / Fly.io / Render) | Adapter registry is in place — adding new adapters is now one file each. The portal-by-portal research + URL pattern + endpoint normalization for 14 ATSes is a separate phase. |
| Translating parent's `modes/<slug>.md` bodies | Parent files are read-only per CLAUDE.md hard rule #1. v1.13.0's locale-aware scaffolding gets you 80% of the way; full body translation requires a PR upstream to `santifer/career-ops`. |

## [1.12.0] — 2026-05-13

Bug-fix + UX + branding pass. Closes 8 items from the post-v1.11.1 honest backlog (test gaps #9–12, console error #8, portals-dead drift #4, seniority_boost surface #6, F-018 endpoint consolidation). Adds a dark/light theme toggle and removes "Airbnb-styled" branding from every doc, package metadata, and the GitHub repo description.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(theme): dark/light toggle (v1.12.0)`** — new theme button in the top bar. Cycles light ↔ dark; persists to `localStorage.theme`; restores on page load via a pre-paint bootstrap (`public/js/lib/theme-bootstrap.js`) so users never see a flash of the wrong colour scheme. Honors `prefers-color-scheme` for first-time visitors. Full dark palette under `[data-theme="dark"]` in `public/css/app.css` — every component reads from CSS custom properties so the swap is centralized in one place.
- **`feat(scan): /api/stream/scan?source=ats|regional|both` (F-018 LITE)`** — single consolidated SSE entrypoint. SPA now opens ONE event-stream that drives both phases sequentially (ATS first, then regional) instead of chaining two separate streams. Legacy `/api/stream/scan-en` + `/api/stream/scan-ru` stay live as deprecated aliases. The runners-table `/api/stream/scan` was renamed to `/api/stream/scan-parent` to clear the namespace; the parent-spawned `scan.mjs` fallback is preserved.
- **`feat(scan): seniority_boost surface (canonical docs §3)`** — both `en-scanner.mjs` and `ru-scanner.mjs` now read `portals.yml::title_filter.seniority_boost` and stamp `_boosted: true` + `_boostedBy: <keyword>` on matching jobs. SPA sorts boosted rows to the top of `#/scan` results and renders a `⬆ boosted` badge with the matching keyword in the title attribute. Two new i18n keys (`scan.boosted`, `scan.boostedBy`) localized across 8 locales.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **`fix(ui): null-safe error message reads in 4 places (#8)`** — `app.js` (top-bar doctor button + global-search pipeline add), `views/tracker.js` (line 112), `views/apply.js` (line 21), `views/evaluate.js` (line 32) all now read `(err && err.message) || '<fallback>'`. Previously a Promise rejection without an Error payload threw "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'message')" in the page-error stream during e2e tear-down.
- **`fix(test): portals-dead drift warning instead of failure (#4)`** — `tests/portals-dead.test.mjs::FIX-C3` previously failed when the parent's `templates/portals.example.yml` drifted to re-enable a slug we'd flagged dead. v1.12.0 converts the assertion into a stderr warning so CI runs green on parent drift; release decisions stay manual. The slug list `KNOWN_DEAD` is preserved as documentation of intent.

### 📝 Branding / docs

- **`docs(brand): strip 'Airbnb' references from every doc (8 locales)`** — README.md, README.es.md, README.pt-BR.md, README.ko-KR.md, README.ja.md, README.ru.md, README.cn.md, README.zh-TW.md, CLAUDE.md, docs/architecture/FRONTEND.md, package.json, and the GitHub repo description all moved from "Airbnb-styled" / "Airbnb-inspired" wording to "Clean, docs-style". CSS file kept its design-token names (they're internal identifiers, no external coupling) but the explanatory comment was rewritten.

### 🧪 Tests

- **New `tests/canonical-docs-coverage.test.mjs` (5 cases)** closes test gaps #9–12: every help bundle references all 5 canonical career-ops.org guides; 16-H2 parity contract per locale; every README references the canonical front page + ≥ 3 sub-guides; `#/reports` view source contains the score-thresholds card scaffold; i18n bundle includes every new v1.11.x key with all 8 locales.
- **New `tests/scan-consolidated.test.mjs` (6 cases)** covers F-018 LITE: `?source=ats|regional|both` dispatches correctly; unknown source emits an error frame; legacy `/api/stream/scan-en` + `/api/stream/scan-ru` still work as deprecated aliases.
- Total: **360 / 360** unit tests (was 349; +11 new). 0 failures. Coverage: **95.62 % line / 84.37 % branch** (up from 94.59).
- 20 / 20 smoke E2E · 23 / 23 comprehensive E2E · **28 / 28 Playwright**.

### 📋 Internal

- `docs/reviews/REVIEW-2026-05-13-v1.12.0.md` — session context, deferred-list summary, refresh procedure for career-ops.org content sync.
- All 8 CHANGELOGs receive this entry.
- GitHub repo description updated to match the new branding.

### Out of scope (deferred to future, unchanged from v1.11.1)

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Batch evaluate SPA page | CLI-only flow per canonical docs; SPA equivalent needs a new view + ≥3 endpoints + fixtures. 2–3 day phase. |
| Full adapter-registry (8 `server/lib/portals/adapters/*.mjs` + 14 new portals + FE rewrite) | F-018 LITE in this release consolidates the API surface; full architectural refactor remains. |
| Full multer pipeline (PR-4) | v1.10.2 closed the data-corruption hole via 415 envelope; full multipart parser + ConversionError envelope is its own phase. |
| Mode-template translations | Coordination with parent project required. |

---

## [1.11.1] — 2026-05-13

Deep career-ops.org/docs integration — follow-up to v1.11.0. Where v1.11.0 added a summary block, v1.11.1 enriches the existing §5 Portals / §7 Scan / §14 Apply sections of every help bundle with the **full CLI flows** (commands verbatim, numbered apply steps, batch-evaluate runner, Playwright setup). The SPA's `#/reports` view gains a score-thresholds card so the documented `≥4.5 / 4.0-4.4 / 3.5-3.9 / <3.5` action table is visible inline.

### 📝 Docs

- **Help bundles (all 8 locales)** — three new subsections per bundle, translated per locale:
  - **§5 Portals → `CLI flow`** — `cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml`; canonical schema for `title_filter` (positive / negative / seniority_boost), `tracked_companies` (name + careers_url required), `search_queries` (pre-built broader web searches).
  - **§7 Scan → `CLI scan flow`** — Option A (`npm run scan` + `--dry-run` / `--company`) for Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever ATS, Option B (`/career-ops scan` inside any AI CLI) for non-API discovery. Output to `data/pipeline.md` + `data/scan-history.tsv`. Action-thresholds table.
  - **§14 Apply → `Full CLI apply flow` + `Batch evaluate` + `Playwright setup`** — 8-step numbered apply flow (`/career-ops apply <company>` → Playwright opens browser → numbered draft answers → human reviews and clicks Submit → `Submitted.` flips tracker `Evaluated → Applied`). Batch runner via `./batch/batch-runner.sh` with `--parallel` / `--min-score` / `--retry-failed`. Playwright install via `npm install` + `npx playwright install chromium` + `claude mcp add playwright`.
- All 8 bundles preserve the 16-H2 parity contract (`tests/help-ui.test.mjs::section-parity` stays green).

### ✨ UI

- **`#/reports`** — new collapsible card at the top of the list view with the canonical score → next-step table (`≥ 4.5 → /career-ops apply`, `4.0–4.4 → apply or /career-ops contacto`, `3.5–3.9 → /career-ops deep`, `< 3.5 → skip`). Sources the link out to `career-ops.org/docs/.../scan-job-portals`. 7 new i18n keys (`rep.thresholdsTitle`, `rep.thrAction`, `rep.thr45`, `rep.thr40`, `rep.thr35`, `rep.thrLow`, `rep.thresholdsSource`) across 8 locales.

### 📋 QA

- **`qa/claude-cowork-browser-test-prompt.md`** — appended **Scenario 17 (career-ops.org/docs coverage)** with 5 sub-assertions (front-matter in 8 locales, CLI-flow subsections in §5/§7/§14, README block in 8 locales, `#/apply` Playwright link, `#/reports` score-thresholds card) + **Scenario 18 (help bundle parity)** for the i18n parity regression.

### Out of scope (deferred)

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| **Batch evaluate SPA page** | Canonical docs describe CLI-only flow; SPA equivalent = new view + ≥3 endpoints + fixtures. Multi-day phase. |
| **F-018 full adapter-registry** | Still queued; label-only slice closed in v1.10.3. |
| **Full multer pipeline** | v1.10.2 closed data-corruption hole via 415 envelope; full parser is its own phase. |

### Test posture

- **348 / 349** unit tests (1 pre-existing parent-data drift).
- Coverage: **94.59 % line / 84.18 % branch**.
- 20 / 20 smoke E2E · 23 / 23 comprehensive E2E · **28 / 28 Playwright**.

### Docs

- `docs/reviews/REVIEW-2026-05-13-v1.11.1.md` — session context + audit.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-05-13

career-ops.org docs integration — minor release because every change is additive (no API breakage, no data-shape changes, no SPA route renames). Closes the v1.10.3 PR-9 deferral.

### 📝 Docs

- **`docs/career-ops-canonical.md` (new)** — single canonical reference distilled from [career-ops.org/docs](https://career-ops.org/docs) and its 5 sub-guides (What is career-ops, Scan job portals, Apply for a job, Batch-evaluate offers, Set up Playwright). All locale help bundles + READMEs translate this file; when career-ops.org/docs changes, regenerate this file first.
- **All 8 help bundles** (`docs/help/{en, ru, es, pt-BR, ko-KR, ja, zh-CN, zh-TW}.md`) gained a new front-matter `About career-ops` section just below the H1 intro: principles, key concepts (Mode / Archetype / Pipeline / Tracker / Report / Scan history), career-ops vs career-ops-ui distinction, action thresholds by score (≥ 4.5 / 4.0–4.4 / 3.5–3.9 / < 3.5), and links to all five canonical guides. H2 count preserved at 16 per locale (`tests/help-ui.test.mjs` parity stays green).
- **All 8 READMEs** gained an `About career-ops` block before the install heading: same principles, score thresholds, and 5 canonical guide links. The `What's new in v1.10.x` history sections were removed from the README front page (CHANGELOG retains the full history).

### ✨ UI improvements

- **`#/apply`** — the info banner now explicitly surfaces the Playwright setup guide (`career-ops.org/docs/.../set-up-playwright`) and a link to the canonical Apply guide. New i18n keys `apply.playwrightHint` + `apply.docsLink` localized for 8 locales.

### 🔧 Internal

- README screenshot path stays at `public/images/screen_vacancy_found.png` (v1.10.1).
- No new server routes, no schema changes, no new tests required (existing i18n + help parity tests cover the new content surface).
- `tests/help-ui.test.mjs` `section-parity` test continues to pass — every locale has the same 16 H2 headings.

### Audit (gaps deferred, NOT in this release)

| Gap | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| **Batch evaluate SPA page** (`./batch/batch-runner.sh` flow) | The canonical docs describe a CLI-only batch loop (`batch/batch-input.tsv` → parallel runner → `batch/tracker-additions/`). A SPA equivalent needs a new view, three new endpoints, fixture data, and tests. Multi-day phase; documented in `docs/career-ops-canonical.md §4`. |
| **Adapter-registry consolidation** (F-018 / full PR-1) | Still queued; `/api/stream/scan-en` + `/api/stream/scan-ru` remain. The label-only slice landed in v1.10.3. |
| **Multer pipeline** (full PR-4) | v1.10.2 closed the data-corruption hole via a 415 envelope; the full multipart parser + ConversionError envelope refactor is its own phase. |

### Test posture

- **348 / 349** unit tests pass (1 pre-existing parent-data drift in `portals-dead.test.mjs`).
- Coverage: **94.59 % line / 84.24 % branch**.
- 20 / 20 smoke E2E · 23 / 23 comprehensive E2E · **28 / 28 Playwright**.

### Docs

- `docs/reviews/REVIEW-2026-05-13-v1.11.0.md` — session context + UI audit gap list.

## [1.10.3] — 2026-05-12

Closes 7 of the 11 v1.10.0 QA findings (F-001, F-010 minimal, F-011 minimal, F-013, F-014, F-015, F-019). The remaining 4 (F-018 — full adapter-registry consolidation; PR-4 full multer pipeline; PR-7 follow-ups; PR-9 doc sweep across career-ops.org docs) are deferred to v1.11.0.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(pdf): Generate-PDF on every long-form surface (F-015)`** — three new SSE endpoints (`GET /api/stream/pdf/report?slug=`, `GET /api/stream/pdf/deep?name=`, `POST /api/stream/pdf/inline { markdown }`) plus a shared `public/js/lib/pdf-generate.js` helper. The **📄 Generate PDF** button now appears on `#/reports/:slug`, `#/deep` (manual + live), `#/evaluate` (manual + live), and `#/interview-prep` (via the deep endpoint). Each kind reuses the v1.10.2 cv-markdown-to-print-HTML helper and lands the result under `output/<slug>-<TS>.pdf` so the existing auto-download flow takes over.
- **`feat(config): regional config group (F-013)`** — `/api/config` now exposes `groups` (`core | runtime | regional`) and `regionalActive` (boolean computed from `portals.yml::russian_portals.sources`). The SPA renders the three groups as collapsible sections; **Regional sources** is auto-collapsed and only present when a regional source is configured.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **`fix(server): global Express error handler (F-019)`** — `PayloadTooLargeError` (e.g. an 11 MB upload to `/api/cv/import`) and `SyntaxError` from `express.json` now return JSON envelopes the SPA can localize (HTTP 413 / 400). Previously the default Express handler returned an HTML stack trace, which broke the SPA's `try { await res.json() }`.
- **`fix(i18n): English tokens no longer leak into non-EN UI (F-001)`** — added localizations for `Pipeline`, `Deep research`, `Follow-up`, `Health`, `Outreach`, `Doctor`, `Quick scan` (the labels users saw in their UI language while the rest of the chrome was translated).
- **`fix(scan): drop EN/RU framing from labels (F-010 minimum)`** — the `#/scan` summary line, two scan-done badges, and the source-filter labels now read "ATS adapters" + "Regional portals". The two SSE endpoints (`/api/stream/scan-en`, `/api/stream/scan-ru`) are retained as-is; full registry consolidation lives in PR-1 / v1.11.0.
- **`fix(scan): Active-Companies counter auto-refreshes (F-011 minimum)`** — view dispatches a `scan:refresh` event after each `refreshResults()`; the counter re-derives "companies with hits in last scan" from the actual `/api/scan-results` payload instead of staying frozen at the view-mount snapshot.
- **`docs(en-ru-framing): sweep across READMEs + help bundles (F-014)`** — `EN sweep` → `ATS sweep`, `RU sweep` → `regional sweep`, `EN scanner` → `ATS scanner`, `EN: Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever, RU: hh.ru + Habr Career` → `ATS adapters (Greenhouse / Ashby / Lever) + regional portals (hh.ru / Habr Career)`. Touches `README.md`, `README.ru.md`, `README.ja.md`, `README.ko-KR.md`, `docs/help/en.md`, `docs/help/es.md`, `docs/help/pt-BR.md`.

### 🧪 Tests

- New `tests/global-error-handler.test.mjs` (2 cases): malformed JSON → 400 JSON; 11 MB upload → 413 JSON.
- New `tests/config-groups.test.mjs` (2 cases): `/api/config` exposes `groups`; `regionalActive` flips on when portals.yml gains a regional source.
- New `tests/pdf-extra-routes.test.mjs` (5 cases): each of `/report`, `/deep`, `/inline` invokes `generate-pdf.mjs` with the documented three positional args; 404 on missing slug; 400 on empty inline markdown.
- Total: **349 / 350** unit tests (1 pre-existing parent-data drift in `portals-dead.test.mjs`).
- Coverage: 94.59 % line / 84.16 % branch.
- 20 / 20 smoke E2E, 23 / 23 comprehensive E2E, **28 / 28 Playwright**.

### 📝 Docs

- `docs/reviews/REVIEW-2026-05-12-v1.10.3.md` — session context + scope-out list.
- All 8 READMEs: badge bumps (tests 340 → 349, release v1.10.2 → v1.10.3), "What's new in v1.10.3" section per locale.
- All 8 CHANGELOGs receive this entry.

### Out of scope (deferred to v1.11.0)

- **PR-1** — full locale-agnostic adapter registry (8 ATS-adapter files + new `/api/stream/scan?source=` consolidating the two existing endpoints + +14 new portals + scan-view rewrite). The label-only slice in this release closes F-010 / F-011 visually; the architectural refactor is a multi-day phase.
- **PR-4** — multer-based CV import pipeline (replaces the v1.10.2 415 envelope with a real multipart parser + ConversionError envelope + dependency review).
- **PR-9** — full career-ops.org docs integration: fetch [career-ops.org/docs](https://career-ops.org/docs) + the 4 sub-guides (scan-job-portals, apply-for-a-job, batch-evaluate-offers, set-up-playwright), translate into 7 non-EN locales, rewrite help bundles + READMEs accordingly, audit UI screens against the documented behavior.

## [1.10.2] — 2026-05-12

Functional-regression patch. Two bugs discovered in v1.10.1 hand-testing closed; documentation surface expanded.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **`fix(cv): /api/cv/import rejects multipart/form-data with 415 (F-016 hardening)`** — any external client (curl `-F`, common HTTP clients) defaulting to `multipart/form-data` previously had its wire envelope (`--boundary…\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="x"…`) stored as `cv.md` content. The SPA's actual path (`Content-Type: application/octet-stream` + `X-Filename`) was unaffected. Route now returns 415 with a hint pointing at the documented contract. Defense-in-depth: octet-stream bodies that sniff as multipart in their first 256 bytes also get 415. `cv.md` is never touched on a 415.
- **`fix(pdf): /api/stream/pdf invokes generate-pdf.mjs with proper positional args`** — was calling the script with `[]`. The script printed its `Usage:` line and exited code 1 — SPA showed the green "PDF generated" toast but no file ever reached disk. The route now reads `cv.md`, renders it to an HTML file under `output/cv-input-<TIMESTAMP>.html` via an in-route markdown-to-print-HTML helper, then spawns `generate-pdf.mjs <input.html> <output.pdf> --format=a4`. Optional `?format=letter` query for US-letter output. When `cv.md` is missing, emits an `error` event + `done { code: 2 }` instead of a fake start frame.

### 🧪 Tests

- New `tests/cv-upload-multipart-reject.test.mjs` (5 cases): SPA happy path returns 200 with clean markdown; `multipart/form-data` → 415; octet-stream body that LOOKS like multipart → 415; empty body → 400; rejected request does NOT modify `cv.md`.
- New `tests/pdf-stream-args.test.mjs` (3 cases): `start` event carries `<input.html> <output.pdf> --format=a4` with absolute paths and the HTML exists on disk; `?format=letter` switches the flag; missing `cv.md` emits the expected error frame.
- Total: **340 unit tests** (was 318). One pre-existing failure in `portals-dead.test.mjs` remains parent-side data drift, unrelated to web-ui.
- Coverage: 94.63 % line / 84.94 % branch.

### 📝 Docs

- New `docs/test-scenarios/` — 21 scenario files in English (index + per-page contracts):
  - 01 smoke / health · 02 CV upload · 03 CV edit-save · 04 CV → PDF download
  - 05 profile YAML · 06 config env · 07 scan · 08 pipeline
  - 09 evaluate · 10 deep research · 11 modes · 12 apply checklist
  - 13 tracker · 14 reports · 15 activity log · 16 interview prep · 17 JDs
  - 18 i18n · 19 help center · 20 security · 21 full funnel
- Each file documents: goal, preconditions, inputs, expected outputs, negative cases, test coverage (file + line range), and manual Playwright steps where applicable.
- New `docs/reviews/REVIEW-2026-05-12-v1.10.2.md` — full session context, scope-out list, verification commands.
- All 8 READMEs: badge bumps (tests 318 → 340, release v1.10.1 → v1.10.2) + "What's new in v1.10.2" section per locale.
- All 8 CHANGELOGs receive this entry.

### Out of scope (deferred to future GSD phases)

PR-1 locale-agnostic adapter registry (still queued), PR-4 multer-based CV import with full conversion pipeline, PR-7 Generate-PDF buttons on reports / evaluate / deep / interview-prep, PR-8 config UI regrouping, PR-9 docs sweep, PR-10 button-by-button localization audit + jsdom CI gate, full Korean retranslation.

---

## [1.10.1] — 2026-05-09

Critical-fixes patch driven by the v1.10.0 QA regression run (`qa/reports/00-FINAL-SUMMARY.md`).

### 🛡️ Security

- **`fix(security): tighten isValidJobUrl + add DNS-rebind defense (PR-3 / F-003)`** — `isValidJobUrl` now rejects RFC1918 (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`), the full 127/8 loopback range, link-local `169.254/16` (incl. AWS IMDS), `0.0.0.0`, CGNAT `100.64/10`, and IPv6 ULA / link-local. New helper `isPrivateOrLoopbackHost()` is exported from `server/lib/security.mjs` and reused by `/api/pipeline/preview`, which now `dns.lookup`s the host on every redirect hop and rejects when the resolved address itself is private — defeats DNS-rebind. DNS-failure fails open (fetch reports the error) so test stubs / DNS-less sandboxes still work.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **`fix(activity): record only successful state changes (PR-5 / F-005)`** — middleware now early-returns on `res.statusCode >= 400`. Rejected pipeline / cv / tracker requests no longer pollute the audit feed.
- **`fix(activity): add profile.save / config.save / cv.import event mappings (F-008)`** — successful `PUT /api/profile` and `POST /api/config` calls now appear in `/api/activity`.
- **`fix(help): alias ko → ko-KR.md so Korean Help body is served (F-002)`** — the SPA sends bare BCP-47 codes (`ko`); the file on disk is `ko-KR.md`. Resolver now walks 4 candidates: exact, region-tag alias, language-only base, then `en.md`.
- **`fix(llm): /api/evaluate honors mode:'manual' (F-009)`** — mirrors `/api/deep`. Manual-mode skips Anthropic / Gemini calls even when a key is set so users can copy the prompt into Claude Code without burning credits.
- **`fix(api): DELETE /api/pipeline accepts ?url= AND body.url, returns 404 on miss (PR-6 / F-017)`** — was silently 200-on-miss with `?url=` only.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(llm): locale propagation through every prompt (PR-2 / F-012)`** — new `resolveLocale(req)` picks a locale from `body.lang` → `body.locale` → `Accept-Language` → `'en'`. New `buildLocaleDirective(lang)` emits a one-line "Respond in X" header. `buildEvaluationPrompt`, `buildDeepPrompt`, `buildModePrompt` now accept and embed `lang`. SPA `API.call()` auto-attaches `Accept-Language` and merges `lang` into JSON bodies.
- **`feat(scripts): post-qa-cleanup.mjs (PR-11)`** — replays the QA-regression cleanup checklist; `--apply` writes, default is dry-run, idempotent. Sweeps RFC1918 / `nip.io` / `test-cloud-*` URLs from `data/pipeline.md` and audits `cv.md` size.

### 🧪 Tests

- New `tests/critical-fixes.test.mjs` (15 cases) covering: F-002 ko alias resolution, F-009 manual-mode opt-out, PR-6 DELETE shape (body / 404 / 400), PR-3 helper unit tests for IPv4 + IPv6 + bracketed forms, PR-2 `resolveLocale` precedence + `buildLocaleDirective` + prompt-builder integration.
- `tests/url-validation.test.mjs` extended with 5 new tests for RFC1918 / link-local / 0.0.0.0 / 127/8 / CGNAT / IPv6 ULA / link-local.
- `tests/activity-log.test.mjs` test 8 updated to assert the new "no log on 4xx" contract.
- Total: **318 unit tests** (was 298; one pre-existing failure in `portals-dead.test.mjs` is parent-side data drift in `templates/portals.example.yml`, unrelated to web-ui code).

### 📝 Docs

- New `docs/reviews/REVIEW-2026-05-09-v1.10.1.md` — full session context + scope-out list + verification commands.
- All 8 READMEs: badge bumps (test count 298 → 318, release v1.10.0 → v1.10.1), screenshot path moved to `public/images/screen_vacancy_found.png`, "What's new in v1.10.1" section added per locale (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese).
- All 8 CHANGELOGs updated with this entry.

### Out of scope (deferred to future GSD phases)

PR-1 (locale-agnostic adapter registry, +14 portals, FE rewrite), PR-4 (multer-based CV import + ConversionError + global error handler), PR-7 (Generate-PDF buttons on reports / evaluate / deep / interview-prep), PR-8 (config UI regrouping), PR-9 (full README/docs/8-help-bundle EN-RU framing sweep), PR-10 (button-by-button localization audit + jsdom CI gate), full Korean help retranslation (the file exists; PR-only fixed runtime delivery).

## [1.10.0] — 2026-05-08

CV import revamp + `#/config` tabs + canonical `#/profile` route.

### ✨ Features

- **`feat(cv): server-side import for .docx / .doc / .odt / .rtf / .pdf / .html / .txt / .md`** — new `POST /api/cv/import` endpoint converts an uploaded document (any common format) into markdown the editor can drop in. Office formats go via **pandoc**, PDF via **pdftotext** from Poppler. Result is sanitized through `stripDangerousMarkdown` (defense-in-depth XSS). Hard cap: 10 MB per upload. Frontend `📁 Upload CV` now accepts the full format set; pretty error toasts when a converter is missing on the host.
- **`feat(cv): auto-download generated PDF when generate-pdf.mjs finishes`** — the streaming Generate-PDF flow now snapshots the latest PDF in the output dir, and on `done` triggers a browser download for the *new* file (no-op if the run produced no new artifact). The existing on-page list still shows every previous PDF.
- **`feat(config): two-tab layout — API keys & runtime + Profile`** — `#/config` now has a tab strip. The first tab keeps the existing `.env` editor (API keys, models, scanner knobs). The new **Profile** tab is a direct YAML editor for `config/profile.yml`: `PUT /api/profile` validates the YAML (must be a mapping, must include `candidate`), stamps a canonical `# Career-Ops Profile Configuration` header if missing, and writes the file. Save propagates without restart.
- **`feat(routes): canonical /#/profile route (was /#/settings)`** — sidebar now points at `#/profile`. The old `#/settings` hash still resolves through the router alias table, so existing bookmarks keep working. Internal route handler renamed; tests updated to reflect the new direction.

### 🧪 Tests

- New `tests/cv-import.test.mjs` (7 cases): `.md` / `.txt` passthrough, empty-body 400, unsupported-extension 422, oversized 413, HTML→markdown sanitization (skips when pandoc absent), PDF→text round-trip with a hand-crafted PDF (skips when poppler absent).
- New `tests/profile-put.test.mjs` (7 cases): happy-path round-trip, header stamping, empty / invalid-YAML / non-object / missing-candidate 400s, oversized 413.
- `tests/playwright-full-cycle.mjs` extended 14 → **16** subtests — adds CV-import via HTML and `PUT /api/profile` round-trip.
- `tests/router.test.mjs` ALIAS regex flipped to assert the new `settings → profile` direction.

### 📚 Docs

- `docs/help/{en,ru}.md` — full updates to sections 2/3/4: new App-settings tabs, edit-via-config message on the read-only Profile page, full upload-format matrix on the CV section, PDF auto-download behaviour.
- `docs/help/{es,pt-BR,ko-KR,ja,zh-CN,zh-TW}.md` — concise mirrors of the new content blocks; section count unchanged (16) so the parity test stays green.

### 🔧 Internal

- New `server/lib/cv-import.mjs` — single source of truth for the format → markdown conversion, with timeout + missing-converter detection that surfaces actionable hints rather than 500s.
- `server/lib/routes/content.mjs` gains `POST /api/cv/import` and `PUT /api/profile` (binary-safe via `express.raw` for the upload, JSON for the YAML PUT).

---

## [1.9.1] — 2026-05-08

Production-readiness pass. Four targeted bug fixes (BF-1..BF-4), Playwright smoke expanded from 5 to 12 tests covering tracker / pipeline / reports / evaluate / config / cv save round-trips. All green in CI.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **`fix(tracker): escape pipes + collapse newlines in every cell, not just notes (BF-1)`** — a company name like `"Acme | Co"` previously broke the markdown table layout (parser split the cell into two). Cell sanitizer now applied uniformly to company / role / reportSlug / notes; companion fix in `parsers.mjs::parseMarkdownTable` adds GFM-compliant `\|` escape support so the round-trip is lossless.
- **`fix(config): wrap updateEnvFile in try/catch (BF-2)`** — `POST /api/config` previously bubbled an unhandled rejection on permission-denied / read-only filesystem. Now returns a clean 500 `{ error: 'failed to write parent .env', details: [...] }`.
- **`fix(llm): soft cap on assembled prompt size for Anthropic SDK calls (BF-3 + BF-4)`** — `/api/evaluate`, `/api/deep`, and `/api/mode/:slug` Anthropic branches now bail with 413 when `bundleProjectContext + prompt` exceeds 200 KB (≈50K tokens). Saves a multi-second roundtrip + tokens vs letting the API complain about context size. The cap is well below any current model ceiling (Sonnet 4.6 = 1M context).

### 🧪 Playwright smoke — expanded coverage

5 → **12** tests. New cases:

- `tracker view renders empty + accepts API-seeded row` — exercises BF-1 by seeding a row with a literal pipe in the company name and asserting the round-trip preserves it.
- `pipeline add-URL form populates the queue` + invalid-URL rejection sweep (loopback, `javascript:`, bare strings).
- `reports view handles empty state` — non-crash assertion.
- `evaluate view returns a manual prompt without API key` — verifies the fallback chain.
- `config GET returns known keys masked` — secrets never leak through `/api/config`.
- `cv.md PUT round-trips with sanitization` — XSS-y bits (script tags, `javascript:` schemes) get stripped end-to-end.
- `pipeline preview proxy strips scripts` — invalid-URL rejection path.

### 📦 Behavior changes (no API contract changes)

- Tracker writes are now lossless against pipe-laden company / role names. Existing rows with raw pipes will start parsing correctly on the next read.
- `/api/{evaluate,deep,mode/:slug}` will now return 413 instead of 502/timeout when the prompt is unreasonably large (200 KB+).

### 🧪 Tests

- **284 unit tests** (no change in count; existing tests still all green after parser update).
- **12 Playwright browser-smoke tests** (was 5).

---

## [1.9.0] — 2026-05-08

P-6 → P-10 from the v1.8.0 backlog all shipped in one bundle. Headline: `server/index.mjs` is now a 130-LOC orchestrator (down from 762, total 1230 → 130 = -89%); every route topic has its own module. Anthropic parity for `/api/evaluate`, multi-CLI shims, expanded i18n parity test, and Playwright browser-smoke wired into CI.

### 🏗️ P-6 — server split-by-concern (phase 2)

Continuation of P-2. Extracted the remaining 9 route topics out of `server/index.mjs` into `server/lib/routes/<topic>.mjs` modules. `index.mjs` is now a pure orchestrator: middleware (security headers + activity log + static), 12 `register<Topic>Routes(app)` calls, and the SPA catch-all.

- `server/lib/routes/activity.mjs` — `/api/activity`.
- `server/lib/routes/config.mjs` — `/api/config` GET/POST (parent .env round-trip).
- `server/lib/routes/health.mjs` — `/api/health` + `/api/dashboard`.
- `server/lib/routes/help.mjs` — `/api/help/:lang`.
- `server/lib/routes/jds.mjs` — full CRUD for `jds/*.txt`.
- `server/lib/routes/llm.mjs` — every LLM-bound endpoint (evaluate, deep, mode, apply-helper, interview-prep).
- `server/lib/routes/pipeline.mjs` — `/api/pipeline*` including the SSRF-safe preview proxy with named constants for timeout / max-redirects / max-body.
- `server/lib/routes/reports.mjs` — `/api/reports*`.
- `server/lib/routes/tracker.mjs` — `/api/tracker` GET + dedup-aware POST.

Behavior unchanged. 283/283 unit tests stayed green at every step. The orchestrator's import surface dropped from 47 lines to 22.

### 🔌 P-7 — Anthropic parity for `/api/evaluate`

`/api/evaluate` previously was Gemini-or-manual. v1.9.0 adds an Anthropic branch (preferred when both keys present), mirroring the routing rule already used by `/api/deep` and `/api/mode/:slug`. Routes through `bundleProjectContext({ modeSlugs: ['_shared', 'oferta'] })` so the model has the cv / profile / mode templates inlined (REVIEW-A1).

New endpoint: **`POST /api/evaluate/test-anthropic`** — smoke check for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, mirrors the existing Gemini smoke. Sends a tiny prompt (≤256 output tokens) so it costs essentially nothing; returns a 200-char sample.

Fallback chain is now: Anthropic → Gemini → manual.

### 🌐 P-8 — Help-center i18n parity (audit + test hardening)

Audited every `docs/help/<lang>.md` for structure parity. All 8 locales already cover the same 14 canonical h2 sections. Tests upgraded:

- `tests/help-ui.test.mjs::every help doc covers the same 14 sections` was checking only en + ru. Now iterates **all 8 locales** (en, es, pt-BR, ko-KR, ja, ru, zh-CN, zh-TW) and asserts the section count for each.
- New test: `tests/help-ui.test.mjs::every help locale has substantive content` — guards against locale stubs by asserting each non-EN locale is at least 30% of `en.md`'s byte length. Compact translations naturally hit 40-50%; a stub would be in single-digit %.

Result: structural parity is now CI-enforced.

### 🤖 P-9 — Playwright browser smoke in CI matrix

`tests/playwright-smoke.mjs` (added in v1.8.0 as opt-in) is now part of the CI workflow. The existing `e2e` job already installs Playwright + Chromium; one new step (`npm run test:e2e:browser`) runs the 5 browser-smoke tests right after the comprehensive node E2E.

Order in CI: unit (Node 18/20/22 matrix) → smoke node E2E → comprehensive node E2E → **Playwright browser smoke** → screenshot artifact upload on failure.

### 🌍 P-10 — Multi-CLI compatibility

Parent career-ops v1.7.0 introduced multi-CLI / Open Agent Skill standard support. The UI sub-project follows the same convention with thin shims pointing at the canonical `CLAUDE.md`:

- `web-ui/AGENTS.md` — Codex / Aider / generic CLI entry point.
- `web-ui/GEMINI.md` — Gemini CLI entry point.

Both shims re-state the hard rules and quick reference but defer to `CLAUDE.md` for the full project-level instructions, so non-Claude CLIs land on the same orientation as Claude Code sessions. The deployed UI itself remains CLI-agnostic at runtime.

### 🧪 Tests

- **284 unit tests** (was 283): +1 new help-locale parity test.
- **5 Playwright browser-smoke tests** — now part of CI, not just opt-in.
- Coverage held.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-08

Hardening, refactor, and SDD bootstrap. Three high-severity correctness/security fixes (A1, A2, A3), four medium ones (B1–B4), six cleanups, audit of the parent career-ops v1.7.0 surface, server split-by-concern (P-2 phase 1), Playwright browser smoke harness, and a full SDD foundation under `docs/` and `.claude/`.

### 🔥 High-severity fixes

- **`fix(deep): inline cv/profile/mode files for Anthropic SDK calls (REVIEW-A1)`** — `/api/deep` and `/api/mode/:slug` previously told the model "read these files first" but the Anthropic SDK has no filesystem. Output was hollow. New `bundleProjectContext({ modeSlugs })` reads `cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `modes/_shared.md`, and the mode template, truncates each at 16 KB, and prepends a `<project_context>` block to the prompt. Verified live: 26 KB grounded markdown response from `claude-sonnet-4-6` for a deep-research call.
- **`fix(runner): SIGKILL escalation after SIGTERM grace period (REVIEW-A2)`** — `runNodeScript` and `streamNodeScript` previously sent only `SIGTERM` on timeout / client-disconnect. A child stuck in a syscall (DNS, blocked socket) ignored it, hanging the SSE connection until Node's GC reaped. Now each path arms a 5 s watchdog that escalates to `SIGKILL`. Promises always resolve.
- **`fix(runner): max-runtime cap on streaming endpoints (REVIEW-A3)`** — every SSE script runner (`/api/stream/{scan,liveness,pdf}`) now has a hard 30-minute ceiling. On expiry: emit `event: error { message: 'maximum runtime exceeded' }`, kill the child via the A2 watchdog, end the response.

### 🛡️ Medium-severity fixes

- **`fix(preview): per-hop redirect validation in /api/pipeline/preview (REVIEW-B1)`** — switched from `redirect: 'follow'` to manual redirect-walking. Each `Location` header is re-validated by `isValidJobUrl`; capped at 3 hops. Hostile boards can no longer bounce us to loopback / private IPs / `file://`. 4 new tests cover the rejection paths.
- **`refactor(keys): hasGeminiKey helper unifies LLM-key checks (REVIEW-B2)`** — direct `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` reads in route handlers replaced with `hasGeminiKey()` from `lib/anthropic.mjs`. Mirrors `hasAnthropicKey()` shape for consistency and easier mocking.
- **`feat(scanners): thread AbortSignal through hh.ru, Habr, Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever (REVIEW-B3)`** — when the SSE client disconnects mid-scan, in-flight HTTP fetches are now aborted instead of running every query to completion and dropping events. `runRuScan` and `runEnScan` accept `opts.signal`; SSE handlers in `/api/stream/scan-{ru,en}` create an `AbortController` and abort on `res.close`.
- **`test(anthropic): log-guard test prevents future API-key leaks via console (REVIEW-B4)`** — captures every `console.{log,info,warn,error,debug}` call during `runAnthropic` happy + error paths, asserts zero output and that the canary key string never appears. Defense-in-depth against a future `console.log(opts)` regression.

### 🧹 Low-severity polish

- **`fix(parsers): defense-in-depth URL gate inside addPipelineUrl (REVIEW-C4)`** — parser-level rejection of non-http(s) values, complementing the route-level `isValidJobUrl`. Optional `opts.validate` for callers that want stricter rules.
- **`docs(readme): badge "tests-88 passed" → "tests-277 passed" (REVIEW-C3)`** — was off by an order of magnitude.
- **`test(i18n): missing-keys diff grouped by locale (REVIEW-C6)`** — when `tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs` finds a gap, output is now `[ru] (3): foo, bar, baz` instead of mixed lines.
- **`docs(review): C1 closed as resolved-on-inspection`** — sanitizer regexes were already in `\x00-\x08` hex form; review entry was a tool-rendering artifact.

### 🏗️ P-2 phase 1 — server split-by-concern

`server/index.mjs` was 1230 LOC, well past the 800-line ceiling. Split into focused modules without behavior change. All 283 unit tests stayed green at every step.

- `server/lib/security.mjs` — `isValidJobUrl`, `stripDangerousMarkdown`, `sanitizeJobDescription`, `isPubliclyExposed`. Re-exported from `index.mjs` for backward-compat with external consumers.
- `server/lib/prompts.mjs` — `bundleProjectContext`, `buildEvaluationPrompt`, `buildDeepPrompt`, `buildModePrompt`, `buildApplyChecklist`.
- `server/lib/store.mjs` — `safeReadApps`, `safeReadPipeline`, `safeListReports`, `checkProfileCustomized`, `ensureRussianPortalsDefaults`.
- `server/lib/routes/scan.mjs` — `registerScanRoutes(app)` for `/api/stream/scan-{ru,en}`, `/api/scan-ru/config`, `/api/scan-results`.
- `server/lib/routes/runners.mjs` — `registerRunnerRoutes(app)` for buffered `/api/run/*` table, streaming `/api/stream/{scan,liveness,pdf}`, generated-PDF list/download.
- `server/lib/routes/content.mjs` — `registerContentRoutes(app)` for CV / Profile / Portals / Modes.

`index.mjs` is now 762 LOC (-38%, under the 800 cap). Phase 2 will extract tracker, pipeline, reports, jds, llm (evaluate/deep/mode), and health into route modules. Targeting <500 LOC for the orchestrator.

### 🔍 Parent career-ops v1.7.0 audit

The user updated the parent project to v1.7.0. Audited every consumed surface — UI is fully compatible. Notable findings documented in `docs/architecture/DATA-FLOWS.md`:

- Modes catalog grew from 7 to 19 files. UI's `MODE_ALLOWLIST` deliberately surfaces only 7 (others are Claude-Code-only). Comment added explaining the intentional narrow scope.
- `portals.yml` schema confirmed: `tracked_companies` (96 entries, 87 enabled, 71 with API). EN scanner reads it correctly; legacy `companies` key still supported.
- New parent surfaces NOT consumed today: `dashboard/` (Go program), `update-system.mjs`, `generate-latex.mjs`, `analyze-patterns.mjs`, `liveness-core.mjs`, `followup-cadence.mjs`, `test-all.mjs`, localized mode subdirs (`de/fr/ja/pt/ru`).
- Live `/api/dashboard`, `/api/health`, `/api/modes`, `/api/portals`, `/api/profile`, `/api/cv`, `/api/jds`, `/api/reports`, `/api/tracker`, `/api/pipeline`, `/api/evaluate`, `/api/deep`, `/api/stream/scan-en` all verified green.

### 🤖 SDD / GSD bootstrap

`career-ops-ui` now has a full Spec-Driven Development foundation aligned with the GSD pipeline (`gsd-*` skills from `superpowers@claude-plugins-official`).

- `CLAUDE.md` (root) — project-level agent system prompt: stack, GSD pipeline, hard rules (parent contract, security envelope, no `--no-verify`), conventions, parent-project boundary.
- `.aiignore` — exclusion list for AI agents: vendored, binaries, parent user data, `.planning/`, `.env`, locale duplicates.
- `.claude/agents/` — three project-specific subagent definitions:
  - `web-ui-route-reviewer.md` — gates new routes against SSRF, CSP, sanitizers, parent-write contract, conventions, tests.
  - `spa-view-reviewer.md` — CSP-safe DOM, i18n, router registration, accessibility.
  - `test-isolation-reviewer.md` — verifies tests are CI-isolated (no parent-project assumptions, no live network, no port collision).
- `.claude/commands/` — slash-command stubs: `/sdd-status`, `/codebase-tour`.
- `docs/` tree — all in English:
  - `PROJECT.md` — what/why/for-whom, scope, constraints, success criteria.
  - `ROADMAP.md` — current milestone + completed history + backlog.
  - `sdd/SDD-GUIDE.md` — discuss → spec → plan → execute → verify → review pipeline mapped to `gsd-*` skills.
  - `sdd/CONVENTIONS.md` — module system, naming, routes, sanitizers, client patterns, i18n, errors, logging, testing, commits, branches, CSS.
  - `architecture/OVERVIEW.md` — top-level diagram, layers, boot sequence, invariants, "where to look first when…" cheat sheet.
  - `architecture/SERVER.md` — per-file map for `server/lib/*.mjs` (updated for P-2 split).
  - `architecture/FRONTEND.md` — SPA structure, view inventory, globals, "how to add a view".
  - `architecture/API.md` — full inventory of every `/api/*` route.
  - `architecture/DATA-FLOWS.md` — every parent-project read/write, with the explicit-user-action contract.
  - `reviews/REVIEW-2026-05-07.md` — static review that produced this changelog's fixes.

### 🔒 Security & repo hygiene

- **`chore(.gitignore): comprehensive defense-in-depth patterns`** — covers env variants, IDE folders, GSD scratch (`.planning/`), per-user agent settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/cache/`, `.claude/state/`, `.claude/memory/`), Playwright artifacts (`playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `.playwright/`, `trace.zip`), heap/CPU profiles, lockfiles for unshipped tooling, expanded macOS Finder noise, generic secret patterns (`secrets.json`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key`).

### 🧪 Tests

- **283 unit tests** (was 277): +6 new (4 for B1 redirect-rejection, 1 for `hasGeminiKey`, 1 for `runAnthropic` log-guard).
- **5 Playwright browser-smoke tests** (new, opt-in via `npm run test:e2e:browser`): dashboard render + version footer, dashboard → scan → pipeline → cv navigation, language-switch persistence, 404 view, health-page render. Resolves Playwright via parent's `node_modules` — no new dependency.
- Coverage held at ~93% line / ~83% branch.

### 📝 New / updated package.json scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run test:e2e:browser` | Run Playwright smoke harness against in-process server (5 tests). |

## [1.7.2] — 2026-05-04

Help center, in-UI App settings, mobile sidebar, single Scan button, and a "Show result" shortcut on every prompt-builder.

### ✨ New features

- **`feat(help): in-app user guide` (`/#/help`)** — long-form Markdown documentation accessible from a new sidebar entry. Covers every page step-by-step: quick start, CV editor, Profile, Scan filters, Pipeline preview, Evaluate, Deep research, Apply, Tracker, Reports, all 7 modes, Activity log, Health, setup hints. Auto-built sticky table of contents from `<h2>` headings, synchronous DOM build (no race). Localized for all 8 supported locales.
- **`feat(config): in-UI App settings page` (`/#/config`)** — edit `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, `HH_USER_AGENT`, `PORT`, `HOST` from the browser. Writes to the **parent project's** `.env` file so career-ops Node scripts AND web-ui's dotenv loader pick up the same source. Secret keys masked on read (first/last 4 chars). Model fields are dropdowns with curated lists (claude-sonnet-4-6 / claude-opus-4-7 / claude-haiku-4-5 / gemini-2.0-flash / etc.). Empty value deletes the key. Values applied to running process.env immediately — no restart for most settings.
- **`feat(modes): "⚡ Show result" button alongside "Copy prompt"`** — when a prompt is generated in manual mode, users no longer have to retype their inputs to get the LLM result. The new button re-submits the same form with `run: true`, falling through to a clear toast (`Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY in .env first`) when no key is configured. Works on `/#/deep`, `/#/project`, `/#/training`, `/#/followup`, `/#/batch`, `/#/contacto`, `/#/interview-prep`, `/#/patterns`.

### 🐛 UX + UI fixes

- **`fix(scan): single Scan button replaces three (Scan all + EN + RU)`** — overwhelming choice, identical default in 99% of cases. The unified `🌐 Scan` button runs every enabled source. Help docs updated across 8 locales.
- **`fix(ui): mobile sidebar drawer`** — viewport <900px now gets a hamburger button (☰) in the topbar; `body.sidebar-open` toggles a CSS transform that slides the sidebar in. Backdrop dim + click-anywhere closes it. Anchor click + hashchange auto-close so the user lands on the new page with the drawer tucked away. Larger viewports unaffected.
- **`fix(server): footer version reflects web-ui, not the parent VERSION`** — `/api/health` now reads web-ui's own `package.json`. The footer no longer leaks a stale `1.6.0` from the parent's version file. Parent's VERSION is still surfaced separately as `parentVersion`.

### 📦 New REST endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET`  | `/api/help/:lang` | Returns the Markdown user guide for the requested locale, falling back to `en.md`. Path-traversal-safe. |
| `GET`  | `/api/config` | Returns current values for all known env keys; secrets masked. |
| `POST` | `/api/config` | Writes the given keys into the parent project's `.env`, validates each value, applies live to `process.env`. |

### 🌐 i18n

- 30+ new keys across `nav.help`, `nav.config`, `help.*`, `config.*`, `deep.showResult`, `deep.needKey`, `scan.btnRun`. All 8 locales populated.

### 🧪 Tests

- `tests/help.test.mjs` (12 cases) — every supported locale returns substantive markdown, EN spot-checks every page slug, unknown lang → EN fallback, path-traversal sanitized, every locale references `cv.md` / `profile.yml` / `.env`.
- `tests/help-ui.test.mjs` (9 cases) — view file registration, sidebar entry, i18n keys present in every locale, docs files exist for every locale, EN/RU help has 14 canonical sections, every #/foo route covered, Show-result wiring on deep + mode-page.
- `tests/env-config.test.mjs` (18 cases) — pure-function tests for `parseEnv`, `maskSecret`, `validateConfig`, `updateEnvFile` (bootstrap, in-place rewrite preserving comments, empty-value delete, quote-when-needed).
- `tests/config-endpoint.test.mjs` (8 cases) — GET masks secrets / returns env path; POST writes to parent .env; live process.env application; empty-value unsets; rejects unknown keys + malformed Anthropic keys with 400.

### 📊 Stats

- **Tests:** 233 → **277** (+44 across 4 new test files).
- **E2E:** 20 smoke + 23 comprehensive = 43 Playwright steps, all green.
- **Coverage:** 93.5% line / 82.6% branch / 93.7% funcs (unchanged — new code is fully tested).

## [1.7.1] — 2026-05-04

Patch release stacking the post-v1.7.0 work: pipeline preview pane, Anthropic API integration, scrollable sidebar, dotenv loader, dynamic Active-companies list, CI workflow hardening.

### ✨ Pipeline preview pane

- **`/#/pipeline` overhaul** — left list + right preview pane. Click any URL to fetch a server-side proxied snapshot (`GET /api/pipeline/preview` strips scripts/styles/tags, caps at 8 KB, validated through `isValidJobUrl`). Live filter input, "In queue" counter, ⚡ "Evaluate first" header button. Inline ▶/✕ on every row plus full Evaluate / Open in tab / Delete on the preview pane. Stable test selectors via `data-url` + `.pipeline-row` + `.pipeline-row-delete` classes. **8 new tests** in `tests/pipeline-preview.test.mjs` (mocked fetch, no upstream binding needed).

### ✨ Anthropic API integration — "Run live" everywhere

- **`server/lib/anthropic.mjs`** — zero-dependency client for Anthropic Messages API (claude-sonnet-4-6 default, override via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`). When `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, every mode page (`/#/deep`, `/#/project`, `/#/training`, `/#/batch`, `/#/contacto`, `/#/interview-prep`, `/#/patterns`) renders an "⚡ Run live (Anthropic)" button as the **primary** action — clicking executes the prompt and renders Markdown back into the browser instead of handing off to Claude Code. Gemini stays as fallback when only its key is set. Manual mode still works with no keys at all. **8 new tests** in `tests/anthropic.test.mjs`.

### 🐛 CI / pipeline fixes

- **`fix(api): tighten pipeline URL validator` (FIX-M7)** — now also rejects loopback hostnames, length <10 or >2000, whitespace inside URLs.
- **`fix(server): actually load .env so HH_USER_AGENT / GEMINI_API_KEY hints work`** — added `server/lib/dotenv.mjs` (35-line zero-dep loader) wired in at the top of `server/index.mjs`. The runtime hints in scanner code finally do something. **6 new tests**.
- **`fix(ui): scrollable sidebar`** — 18 nav items in 6 groups overflowed shorter viewports. `.sidebar` now has `overflow-y: auto` with thin custom-styled scrollbars.
- **`fix(ui): make HH_USER_AGENT banner dismissible`** — then removed entirely from `/scan` once we realized it was overkill. Health page check still surfaces it.
- **`fix(scan): Active companies list is now collapsible + filterable + grouped`** — 87 tags flat was overwhelming. Now a "▸ Active companies 87/71" toggle expands an ordered list (✓ API-backed first, ○ websearch second) plus a search filter.
- **`fix(test): isolate api.test.mjs + en-scanner.test.mjs from parent project`** — both now spin up tmp project roots so CI works without the parent checked out alongside web-ui.
- **`fix(workflow): publish-package version-match only on release events`** — `workflow_dispatch` from main no longer fails the tag/version check.
- **`fix(e2e): stable selector for pipeline row delete`** — restored anchor wrapper + added `data-url` attribute so e2e suite is selector-stable.

### 📦 New REST endpoint

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/pipeline/preview?url=…` | Server-side proxy: returns visible-text snapshot of the URL (scripts/styles stripped, 8 KB cap), gated by `isValidJobUrl`. |

### 📊 Stats after this batch

- **Tests:** 225 → **233** (8 more on top of v1.7.0).
- **Test files:** 25 → **26**.
- **E2E:** 20 + 23 = 43 Playwright steps, all green.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-03

A 35-commit hardening + UX + feature-completion pass driven by QA r5. Three security layers landed (XSS sanitization, CSP, input validation), every missing CRUD endpoint was filled in, the parent-project bootstrap is now fully automated, and the UI gained **9 new pages** — Activity, redesigned Deep Research, plus 7 sidebar-grouped modes (project / training / followup / batch / outreach / interview-prep / patterns) covering 100% of parent's `modes/`. Pipeline gained a server-side preview pane. Anthropic API integration makes "Run live" a one-click action across all modes. Test coverage went from **73** to **225**, across **25 test files**, plus **23 comprehensive Playwright e2e steps**. GitHub Actions ship CI / AI review / Release / Publish-Package workflows.

### 🔒 Security

- **`fix(cv): sanitize CV markdown to block stored XSS in preview` (FIX-C10)** — `PUT /api/cv` now strips `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<style>`, `<form>`, `<svg>`, `on*=` event handlers, and `javascript:`/`vbscript:`/`data:text/html` URIs before writing `cv.md`. Body capped at 1 MB (413 on overflow). Client-side `UI.md()` was rewritten to escape every byte before any markdown transformation runs, so raw HTML can never reach `innerHTML`. Link `href` attributes are validated against an allowlist of safe schemes (`http`/`https`/`mailto`/`tel`/relative + `data:image` only). 17 new tests across the strip helper and HTTP round-trips.
- **`fix(server): add CSP and baseline security headers` (FIX-L2)** — every response now carries `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`. When the server binds beyond loopback (`HOST` ≠ `127.0.0.1`/`::1`/`localhost`), a strict `Content-Security-Policy` is layered on top: `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'` (no `unsafe-inline`), Google Fonts whitelisted, `connect-src 'self'` blocks XSS exfiltration. Inline `onclick` handlers in `index.html` and `router.js` were moved to `addEventListener` to keep the strict CSP intact. 8 new tests gating CSP across 5 different `HOST` values.
- **`fix(api): tighten pipeline URL validator` (FIX-M7)** — `POST /api/pipeline` used to accept `"not-a-url"` and persist it. Now `isValidJobUrl()` rejects bare strings, inputs <10 or >2000 chars, whitespace-containing URLs, non-`http(s)` schemes, and loopback hostnames (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`::1`). Folds in **FIX-M3** + **FIX-M6** (return 400 on invalid, plus a `deduped` flag on success).
- **`fix(server): actually load .env so HH_USER_AGENT / GEMINI_API_KEY hints work`** — previously the runtime told users to "set HH_USER_AGENT in .env" but the server never read that file, so following the instruction did nothing. Adds a 35-line zero-dependency dotenv loader (`server/lib/dotenv.mjs`) wired in at the top of `server/index.mjs`. Process-env values set on the command line still win, so existing CI overrides aren't shadowed. Parent's `.env.example` now includes a documented `HH_USER_AGENT` block with a real-Chrome User-Agent example. 6 new tests.
- **`fix(api): sanitize JD before prompt assembly` (FIX-M5)** — `POST /api/evaluate` strips ANSI escapes, control bytes, inline `<script>` tags, and trims whitespace before either calling Gemini or echoing the prompt back. 50 KB length cap. The 50-char minimum runs against the *sanitized* text, so prompt-injection attempts that look long enough but consist mostly of escapes fail-fast with 400.
- **`fix(health): mask Node version + project root when HOST!=loopback` (FIX-M1)** — `/api/health` no longer fingerprints the host on LAN-exposed deployments. Loopback responses keep the values for local diagnostics.

### ✨ New features

- **`feat: 7 new sidebar modes + grouped sidebar` (FIX-C8)** — covers 100% of the parent's `modes/` directory with no UI gaps. New routes: `#/project` (portfolio project advisor), `#/training` (course / cert evaluation), `#/followup` (per-application cadence), `#/batch` (parallel URL processor), `#/contacto` (LinkedIn outreach drafter), `#/interview-prep` (stage-specific prep), `#/patterns` (rejection-pattern analyzer). All seven share a single config-driven view factory (`public/js/views/mode-page.js`) and a single generic endpoint `POST /api/mode/:slug` — adding a new mode in the future is one config row + one i18n block. Sidebar reorganized into 6 groups: Sourcing / Decision / Application / Networking / Analytics / Setup. 18 nav items total. 12 new tests in `tests/modes-endpoints.test.mjs`.
- **`fix: bootstrap parent deps + russian_portals defaults` (FIX-C4 + C9 + C12 + H2)** — `bin/start.sh` now installs the parent's `node_modules` (js-yaml, playwright, jsdom) AND `npx playwright install chromium` on fresh clones, so `/api/stream/scan`, `/pdf`, and `/liveness` work end-to-end out of the box. `createApp()` probes `portals.yml` on every boot — if the `russian_portals:` block is missing, appends a documented default with comments. Idempotent: the second boot is a no-op. 3 new tests.
- **`fix: disable 9 dead portal slugs in template + health-check script` (FIX-C3)** — `templates/portals.example.yml` now ships with Ada / Factorial / Tinybird / Weights & Biases / Travelperk / Clarity AI / Forto / Vinted / Runway flagged `enabled: false` (each entry has an inline reason comment). New installs scan **87** alive companies instead of 96. New `web-ui/scripts/portals-health-check.mjs` HEAD-probes every enabled `careers_url` and reports DEAD entries with a suggested patch list (JSON output via `--json`). 3 new tests.
- **`feat(activity): user-action log + Activity sidebar page`** — every state-changing API request is captured to `data/activity.jsonl` (timestamp, action verb, target, success flag, optional detail). New sidebar entry **Activity** with action-prefix chip filters (pipeline / cv / jd / evaluate / scan / stream / script), action ✓/✗ badges, and refresh button. Auto-rotates at 5 MB. 10 new tests covering middleware, read filters, corrupt-line tolerance, and the recursion guard for `GET /api/activity` itself.
- **`feat(deep): view Deep Research in browser + saved-results archive`** — the Deep Research page now (a) runs the prompt through Gemini live when `{ run: true }` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set, persisting output to `interview-prep/{slug}.md`; (b) lists every saved deep-research file as clickable cards with relative timestamps; (c) renders results as Markdown with **📋 Copy / ⬇ Download .md / ↗ Open in tab** actions per result. New REST surface: `GET /api/interview-prep`, `GET /api/interview-prep/:name`, `DELETE /api/interview-prep/:name`. 7 new tests.
- **`feat(cv): generate + download PDF in browser, with PDF archive`** — new **📄 Generate PDF** button on the CV page streams `/api/stream/pdf` in a modal console. On `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` / `playwright` errors, it surfaces a copy-pasteable bootstrap command. New "Generated PDFs" section auto-loads after each successful run, listing every `output/*.pdf` with **↗ Open** and **⬇ Download** buttons. New REST surface: `GET /api/output/pdfs`, `GET /api/output/pdfs/:name`. 6 new tests.
- **`feat(api): POST /api/tracker — append rows from the UI` (FIX-H8)** — append a canonical row to `data/applications.md` from the browser. Validates company + role, normalizes status against `templates/states.yml`, auto-increments zero-padded `#`, dedups by company+role (case-insensitive), pipe-escapes notes so the markdown table doesn't fracture. Bootstraps the table when the file is empty. 6 new tests.
- **`feat(api): DELETE /api/jds/:name` (FIX-H4)** — remove saved JDs without shelling out. Path-traversal characters are stripped before any filesystem touch; the parameter must end in `.txt`. 5 new tests, including `../../etc/passwd` refusal.
- **`feat(api): POST /api/evaluate/test-gemini` (FIX-H7)** — smoke-test endpoint that runs a 50-char dummy JD through `gemini-eval.mjs` so the user can verify the API key works without sitting through a real evaluation. Returns `{ ok, code, sampleLength, sample }`.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **`fix(router): catch-all 404 view + i18n coverage guard` (FIX-C7)** — unknown hash routes used to silently fall back to the dashboard, masking typos and broken bookmarks. Now `#/totally-random-xyz` renders a dedicated 404 page that quotes the bad path back and links to the dashboard. The 404 view is registered inside the router IIFE itself so it cannot collide with any user route. New `tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs` runs `i18n.js` inside a `vm.Context` with a stub `window`, exposes the private `DICT`, and asserts every one of the 173+ keys × 8 locales is populated and non-empty. 4 new router tests.
- **`fix(router): alias #/profile → settings` (FIX-C2)** — the internal route name is `settings` (with `nav.settings` rendering "Profile") but external links and muscle memory go to `#/profile`. Now both addresses reach the same view, and the sidebar nav-item lights up either way. 2 new tests.
- **`fix(health): unify Health/Doctor + flag template profiles` (FIX-C6 + FIX-H6)** — Health and Doctor were two different sources of truth. Now `/api/health` exposes everything Doctor reports (parent-deps, Playwright, dirs, profile-customized, `HH_USER_AGENT`). The `Profile customized` check detects placeholder names (`Jane Smith`, `Alex Doe`, `John Doe`, `Your Name`, `Test User`) and explicit YAML parse errors. 4 new tests.
- **`fix(scan): warn on query↔negative collisions in RU config` (FIX-H3)** — when `portals.yml` ships with `"PHP"` in `title_filter.negative` while the queries target Senior PHP, every match gets filtered and the user sees zero results. `loadConfig()` now computes a `warnings` array; `runRuScan()` emits each warning as an SSE stderr line before the scan starts. 2 new tests verify the shipped defaults stay PHP-friendly out of the box.
- **`fix(scan): warn when HH_USER_AGENT is unset` (FIX-H1)** — the `/scan` page probes `/api/health` and shows a yellow warning card above the action row when `HH_USER_AGENT` is empty, so users know about the hh.ru 403 *before* they click RU scan.
- **`fix(api): warn when POST /api/jds slug had unsafe chars stripped` (FIX-M2)** — slug normalization that strips dangerous characters now returns a `warning` field; pure case/whitespace cleanup stays silent. Empty result after sanitization returns 400.
- **`fix(ui): clear global search on route change + button spinners` (FIX-M4 + FIX-L1)** — the global-search input is cleared on `hashchange` (with a guard for active typing). New `UI.withSpinner(button, fn)` helper wires loading state, ARIA, and double-click prevention into every async button click. Already adopted on Doctor / Verify / sync-check / Save CV / Normalize / Dedup / Merge buttons.
- **`fix(ui): make sidebar scrollable so 18 nav items always reach the footer`** — the grouped sidebar from FIX-C8 overflowed shorter viewports; bottom items (Activity / Health) were clipped. `.sidebar` now has `overflow-y: auto` with thin custom-styled scrollbars (WebKit + Firefox). Footer stays pinned via the existing `margin-top: auto`.
- **`fix(ui): empty modal-title placeholder` (FIX-H9)** — the hardcoded English `"Title"` string in `index.html` is gone, closing the brief race window where it was visible during modal open.

### 🌐 i18n

- 173+ translation keys × 8 supported locales (`en`, `es`, `pt-BR`, `ko`, `ja`, `ru`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`). New keys added across all locales for: 404 page, activity log, deep research, PDF flow, security warnings, tracker mutation, apply rename. Coverage is now enforced by `tests/i18n-coverage.test.mjs` — every key must have a non-empty value in every supported locale or CI fails.

### ⚙️ DevOps

- **Test count:** 73 → **201** (+128 tests across 23 test files). The single remaining failing test (`runEnScan: dry-run end-to-end across multiple sources`) is a pre-existing flake dependent on Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever live API responses.
- **Comprehensive Playwright e2e** (`tests/e2e-comprehensive.mjs`, 23 steps): walks the full user journey — CV save → preview → PDF generation → all 7 new modes → tracker filters → activity log → 404 → modal ESC → sidebar scroll → Ctrl-K focus → search clear → profile alias → language persistence.
- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/`):
  - `ci.yml` — unit + integration tests on Node 18/20/22 matrix, plus i18n coverage gate (every key × 8 locales must be non-empty), plus the full Playwright e2e on every PR.
  - `ai-review.yml` — Claude Code AI review on every PR. Maintainers retain merge authority; Claude only suggests. Skip via `skip-ai-review` label.
  - `release.yml` — auto-publish a GitHub Release when a `v*.*.*` tag is pushed; release notes are sliced from `CHANGELOG.md` so all 8 language variants stay the canonical source.
- **CSP-friendly UI:** all inline `onclick` handlers removed from `index.html` and `router.js`. The strict `script-src 'self'` policy is now enforceable without breaking any feature.

### 📦 New REST endpoints

|---|---|---|
| `GET`    | `/api/activity`                  | List user-action events, newest first |

| `GET`    | `/api/interview-prep/:name`      | Read a single Deep Research file |
| `DELETE` | `/api/interview-prep/:name`      | Remove a Deep Research file |
| `GET`    | `/api/output/pdfs`               | List generated PDFs |
| `GET`    | `/api/output/pdfs/:name`         | Stream a PDF as an attachment |
| `POST`   | `/api/tracker`                   | Append a row to `applications.md` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/jds/:name`                 | Remove a saved JD |

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-02

Initial public release of the web UI. See `README.md` for the feature inventory at this baseline.
